       " 'one simply could not ask for more allow me to preface this with a little history i am was a casual reader who owned a book simple touch from i ve read the harry potter series girl with the dragon tattoo series brave new world and a few other key titles fair to say my book did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs fast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindly paperwhite and i have to admit i m in love not just with the kindly but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindly the investment of is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindly you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the book that hindered me for the past years i was never inspired to pick it up get it into my hands and just dive in there was never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply odore my kindly if you are considering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week downloaded books and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left as well make yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you',\n",

surprised but i decided it was a minor nuisance what really put me over the edge is that about months after i purchased my kindly i noticed that my screen was cracked as i was pulling it out of my backpack now i really take care of my things so i was surprised that it broke nothing against the quality of the product but it was definitely surprising because it is fairly well protected with a padded sleeve in my backpack anyhow i called into amazon support to see what i could do about it but they told me that i would have to buy a new one the support person i spoke to on the phone said that she would try to speak to her supervisor to see if they would be willing to replace it for me but later came back and said that they can not replace it and that they would have to sell me a new one at a reduced rate at this point i m thinking im going to skip out on the reduced price kindly for that they offered me and i m going back to my ipad why well for one i won t have to pay the additional money for otherwise free apps two i know that i will have my ipad covered under warranty no matter what happens so the key thing to keep in mind before you buy a kindly is the following there are no official repair facilities so if you break your screen you are forced to buy a new one if you go with something more common like an ipad or a android tablet you can find repair facilities all around and with apple you can get the extended care and they will replace your ipad screen or even your whole ipad if when you break it apps are more expensive because you can not buy them from google play you have to buy higher priced versions of the exact same app from amazon later if you decide that the kindly isn t for you you have just wasted all that money on apps that will stay with a useless kindly the apps thing is wearable but the lack of repair facilities or help is not i think i would be have given the kindly start if they offered and extended protection plan so that we knew that we were going to keep our purchase for a longer period of time i mean let s face it the probability of anyone damaging their kindly within the life expectancy of the product is fairly high so your investment is this product will last as long as you can maintain it in good shape at this point i m cutting my losses and moving back to the ipad\",\"this needs to be way better for the amount i spent on it the connection drop s out on this unit pretty bad i can hardly get thru a game and it will disconnect\",\"dead after weeks worked great for a few weeks then completely stopped working don

become an indispensable part of my daily life the fit and finish of that product is top notch and so i was eager to see if this one matches the quality i have come to expect from amazon short answer it does everything works perfectly and i still have trouble believing that they packed this much awesomeness into such a small box having had bad experiences with streaming video in the past i was a little wary about trying this but i needn t have worried browsing menus is fast the voice search works great and watching movies is flawless a nice touch is all of the detailed help videos which are included as the first thing you see after you set up the device even setup is easy fast and fun hook it up to the tv plug it in enter network password wait for a short update and that s it ready to go nice job big a keep this up and you will force me to buy all of your products\",\"great for entire family it helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like\",\"it s always good to buy on sale the reason i purchased this style of kindly it s small just like a paperback book and very portable so far so good i m enjoying every minute of use the os is very friendly user driven easy to navigate shopping apps and books is very easy the user interface takes a bit to get use too if you are use to using tablets with ios windows or android there is a very short learning curve the one aspect i like is the ability to group your items games books and the ability to make a new group keeps the confusion down the clarity and speed of the kindly is great i m very impressed by it s sharp image i only use a wi fi connection so the movies stream without a problem well worth the purchase on sale\",\"can not get it to work i have dish not sure if that is the problem i connected one end of the him cable into him port so on turned on tv no screen guide for set up\",\"good but need some improvements i would give it a star review if it didn t keep having recurring issues with wired ethernet connection for some reason i have to keep taking out the ethernet cable and plugging it back in the device in order for it to recognize the wired connection now the funny thing is that the wifi connection works fine the reason that is funny or ironic is that typically that is where most devices have an issue when it comes to internet connection the reason i choose being wired in is because i want fast data transfer now the fire works well with everything else very smooth and the interface is well laid out\",\"amazon enable the usb port for external storage i love the amazon fire tv but i considered giving it only stars for the comments listed below but i really like it ok after only owning the amazon fire tv since last friday april th i suspected the limited gb of internal memory would be a problem and it is as of last night april th my fire tv internal storage was full i was trying to install the des ex game that is available for fire tv and received that message that i needed to delete something so i started deleting a few games and finally had enough deleted that it started downloading again except i think it started all over again about of the way through downloading the nd time i got the same message to delete some more so i deleted a few more games and then it took off downloading again from the beginning again then it completed the download and started installing the game and then i got the same message again for a rd time that made me say a few choice words that point i said to heck with it and figured i d wait to see if amazon does anything about this so i spent on a game i didn t get to play see the usb port isn t enabled so there is no support for external storage from what i saw the fire tv app takes up gb of the total gb available heck the walking dead app alone is over gb in size i can t verify this but i swear each time i was downloading des ex it used up another mb of memory and when the download didn t complete i didn t get the storage back so in attempts to get it installed i swear i used up to gb of internal storage that is still gone i was looking through all of the apps games that i have installed and didn t add it up but i really don t have that much installed right now and it only looks like it amounts to to gb but where the other to gb is is a mystery i deleted like total games with a couple of them in the to mb range and never got des ex installed amazon needs to get this fixed fast for anybody that purchased the fire tv for any sort of android gaming purposes just hope they fix it faster than out did which took like months plus to enable external storage i would like to add that it is a huge engineering oversight in my opinion to only give the fire tv gb of internal store just enable the usb port to allow for external store i would gladly go out and buy a gb usb memory stick or even spend the to on a gb external hard drive in this day and age the fire tv should come with at least gb of internal storage that would allow for at least the storage of mb game considering maybe gb would be used up for the amazon fire tv app that would be reasonable and fair today gb is used for the fire tv app leaving less than gb of internal store considering the walking dead is over gb just by itself that leaves only gb left what is left only allows for more mb games so a system that only allows the installation of to games apps at mb each clearly isn t big enough\",\"no way to just see prime stuff i really like the equipment it is small and works well the voice search feature is nice could have been a home run fire stars however not being able to down select to see just prime not so cool even the ipad app does that so one star for that go fix it update your software\",\"great

model since it does have these features here are my initial impressions of the kindly fire hd i like the placement of the on off volume buttons being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one i never cared for the carousel this is what you see when you turn your kindly on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed and now there s an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead and the apps books can be rearranged to your liking i was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar which is now being called home i don t know why amazon removed this option and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel but you can still bookmark your favorite web pages youtube videos for easy access when i play songs purchased from amazon s mp store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style nice feature but it doesn t work on every song this device has a cool new feature called quick switch which allows us when reading or using an app to bring up recently accessed items with a swine instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one in terms of sound i find it to be tiny and not as rich as it is on the original vfd but you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds ironically music sounds baffled

as i bought it when it arrived however it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home wifi so i called my internet provider i faded through that company automated menu

established between my kindly and my wifi i again asked for a telephone number in case i had further problems im sorry i do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me well i

dollar per month bill which includes ms internet in theory in reality i never see that telephone which i don t use because i have verizon home phone connect and tv with whole house dvr all the premium channels which i never watch ndtv etc after losing my job and having time warner get extremely nasty because i chose to spend what bucks i had left on food and gas rather than paying them and the fact that they have the worst service i had to swap out my box and waited in line for over an hour just to swap it out and then when the new box didn t work wait yet another hour in line to get a rd box i have decided no more two amazon fire tv is the corner stone of my plan to cut the cord i ve only had it for awhile tonight but i am so far blown away the voice recognition works flawless ok reviewers here raise your hand if your first search term was porn yeah i m immature regardless of what inappropriate word or attempts to baffled the system my teenage son and i threw at it it recognized everything with the exception of his latin ok amazon fire doesn t recognize latin but neither do i went to the youtube app because that is a part of my plan to ditch two could i play shows that were on youtube that i currently watch via cable check paired with my computer a mac i just searched for the video that i want hit play on the computer and it automatically is displayed on my tv i ve only had it boxed for hour so haven t tried netflix or hulu etc yet but one of the key activities i do a lot of is watching vod from amazon and it is voodoo much easier to do it using this device that via my bluray player picture quality even of standard def youtube videos is nearly as good as cable the next step of my plan to ditch two is getting fiber optic del installed once that has occurred i will be going from a dollar per month monopoly to bucks per month plus whatever i choose to spend on renting movies etc on demand and i never have to wait in line for hours to swap out hardware that i m renting from the cable company so for half the cost of months worth of time warner i m going to be able to preserve what little is left of my sanity which isn t much given that i tried testing this out with bad words like a kindergarten and the most fun i have had in awhile is listening to the cable customer service rep spend nearly an hour in trying to talk me out of not leaving him what if we gave you everything you have now for then would you stay me no if you could provide the same level of service for bucks less than you have been for the last year why didn t you just do it then rather than making me pay over bucks a month more than i needed to him what if i bumped up your internet bandwidth to the next tier for free me because i m not even getting the advertised speed as it is

useful at present hdi and optical audio out and you have a sleek and capable hardware unit though missing a few nice things like an sd card slot amazon wants you to use the cloud or networked storage the power and memory at hand here promise a fast smooth user experience and the fire does seem to deliver that based on my initial use with these specs this is the fastest box out there currently this is also a box that is somewhat serious about gaming support as it has an internal onboard gpu and an available controller many game developers seem excited about the prospects and market this device represents currently you get a free game and amazon coins for each controller you purchase update i have tried several games and they are great fun graphics are surprisingly good controls smooth really pretty impressive for this type of system with p streaming and dolly digital plus surround sound the picture and sound is great it runs android basically kitkat so lots of apps should be available right out of the gate with lots more to follow some people are grossing about the price but i do not feel it is out of line at all and indeed it seems like a bargain compared to the competition s hardware capabilities to me you get a decent amount of performance hardware for your money so i think it s fine and i m sure there will be specials later for those who can wait i could not wait myself and ordered one immediately i like the roku i own several but this was too tempting to a geek like me clearly the fire tv aims to challenge the other contenders such as apply tv roku and chromecast each has their strengths and weaknesses but the fire tv seems like it will appeal to many you might not be too tempted if you already have a roku but if you are a resident of the amazon ecosystem you may find the fire a great asset those new to the game will find it worthy of consideration there are still a few rough edges as with any new product but none that seem too significant to me most will probably be addressed in short order but the main thing is that there s plenty out of the box that amazon got right and the fire delivers a great experience set up is very easy and straight forward the bluetooth remote is a nice touch for example and the voice search is promising while it currently seems limited to amazon content hopefully this will expand at some point even so it s fun to use streaming seems to be smooth and glitch free in my tests so far mostly with amazon prime instant and netflix i will do more testing and update this review as i learn more load times are generally very fast sometimes almost instantaneous and the fire tv is quite responsive video quality is very good the menu is decent enough similar to roku and others it is a bit amazon centric as you might expect hopefully future updates will allow one to customize it a bit more but simple and sweet is what most people want and that s what you get here your amazon video library and watch lists are available of course a lot of my favorites like prime instant netflix pandora iheartradio and so on are here radio is missing and i hope it gets added soon i m sure all the main ones will get on board it s just too big a market to ignore i have not had time to set up alex yet but that promises to be a great feature for sharing photos music and videos from other devices including a pc laptop or tablet i have alex in the past and it generally worked very well i will be very interested to see how it goes with the fire tv and will update here amazon seems to have taken particular care to address the suffering issues sometimes experienced with devices of this type and i have not seen any such issues so far at all dicembre to come as i have more time and experience with this device giving it a solid stars for now pending further time with it i really like the fire tv and likely will upgrade to stars if no glitches turn up upgraded to stars everything working well gaming is a lot of fun gfx better than expected everything loads faster than any other system i have used sony netgear roku etc everything looks great i feel like the value is there especially if you are already in the amazon ecosystem but non amazon stuff like the netflix app also work well i hooked my amazon fire tv up my season projector and game big and it was a blast prime instant kids and netflix looked great as well the fast responsive interface and overall happy performance make for a great experience gaming i got peptide gp for the amazon fire tv still waiting for my game controller so played using only the fire tv remote but even so it was a lot of fun especially big screen using my projector reminds me of playstation games a good thing the graphics are darn good better than i expected and the game is a lot of fun and fairly easy to pickup and play the game controls work well even using just the remote this is the first game i ve tried on the fire tv and i was very surprised and pleased with the quality definitely worth a try if you like racing games update got my controller works well asphalt peptide gp and sev zero all look great and play great very impressive i think the

little more elegant than when we ordered our fist e reader way back when but it carries the glossy black look they used in the past now for the fire tablets the box was easy open and the device neatly tucked inside hook up was as easy as it gets and connecting to my wifi wasn t a problem it did need a software update out of the box which these days isnt uncommon the problem here was i was already seeing an issue it kept telling me my connection seemed slower than usually i needed to check it having the robust network we must have for a house full of online gamers i knew there could only be a couple of problems my other devices were working fine on the network but to alleviate any strain on it i disconnected them all and reset my connection at the modem and router the download resumed but still with the same message at the bottom after about or minutes i finally got the introduction video so off and running i go the app store to spend the coins i got for purchasing the additional controller see this review http www amazon com review rgdzlyoubidi refcmcrrdpperm while trying to download a handful of games which it ques nicely to keep from over working its self i ran into these problems the interface was slow load images for the apps i was looking at and sometimes refused to populate the list i was trying to view it also would randomly disconnect from the network this points to a connection issue that i stated earlier but now i am convinced it is the wifi radio in the device i have had gaming systems and streaming devices in this room before and never experienced this issue this could also be what was causing the previously stated issue with the menus there is no way to force sleep the unit or turn it off so i proceed to call tech support the guy on the phone was really nice and tried to be helpful but he had no training on the device other than what little he had played around with his he says the device will eventually go to sleep but isnt sure of how long it will take as far as the wifi goes he suggested doing everything i had already done except for unplugged the device for about seconds or so so i try this he has me stream something from prime which works great but as soon as i start to download something again the connection is lost the phone call ends up being a waste of time at this point i am disappointed i know this is a new device and will have issues but the wifi this is proven tech it should work pros beautiful minimalist designers of setupsmall foot printgames look great once you get them to workcons customer service wasn t trained on trouble shootingwifi connectivity sporadic way to force sleep or power down device the end it could be a great product i am going to give it some time and see if another software update might be on the way or if maybe something was wrong with my network yesterday i will update soon update after a full weekend of putting the fire tv through the paces i have updated my initial star rating to a four here are the reasons why the network issue appears to be just that a network issue whether it was on my end or because of it being the first full day of release i do not know but i did not have the connection issue again all weekend seeing as this was the biggest reason for my star rating i have changed that as far as the auto sleep mode for those that like to be able to control when something is on sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t the fire is very sickle about this but as someone pointed out in the comments and i do agree with them it is a very minimal power draw and as along as you don t leave your tv on it shouldn t affect anything the few games i played were good as far as casual gaming goes no buggy or jerk movements but you must remember this is for casual gaming you are not going to console quality out of this hope this all helps\",\"fire tv vs everything else streaming and gaming function fpresizeplayerspace prefix w h try var firm parent document

people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this new vfd replaces last year s basic kindly fire although it has some cool new features it lacks a camera microphone and hdi port for this reason i m glad i kept my model since it does have these features here are my initial impressions of the kindly fire hd i like the placement of the on off volume buttons being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one i never cared for the carousel this is what you see when you turn your kindly on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed and now there s an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead and the apps books can be rearranged to your liking i was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar which is now being called home i don t know why amazon removed this option and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel but you can still bookmark your favorite web pages youtube videos for easy access when i play songs purchased from amazon s mp store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style nice feature but it doesn t work on every song this device has a cool new feature called quick switch which allows us when reading or using an app to bring up recently accessed items with a swine instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one in terms of sound i find it to be tiny and not as rich as it is on the original vfd but you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds ironically music sounds baffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers holding it this way projects the sound out to you read more\",\"good reader but connection problems disappointing kindly charging is sometimes interrupted by loss of connection between cover and kindly complained and they sent me another cover it works better but still losses connectivity from time to time have to stop and disconnect cover and reconnect it that usually stops the problem for a while also it is not clear from the sales materials that the premium leather cover is sued it shows scratches from fingernails on the plus side the oasis screen is good and the quality of the text is excellent lighting is even and reading is easy on this device\",\"great product no issues at all wish it were water proof my kids and family love it\",\"i love my fire tv i got mine from an electronics store because i didn t want to wait for it to arrive in the mail setup was a breeze i don t have cable so prior to this i had to hook my laptop up to my tv to enjoy prime and netflix content on it i m also really pleased that they added a youtube app that was the number one drawback for me when considering this device from what i ve read i figured i d sideload one but they saved me the trouble once i signed in to youtube and linked my mobile devices i even gained the ability to send content to my tv for viewing i don t have a fire phone or kindly although i do have a paperwhite so i m not able to comment on the connectivity with those i can t say enough good things about this tiny box i ve had it for a couple of months and use it every day the user interface is intuitive and efficient i really love the screen save pictures too most of them are breathtaking and they seem to update periodically the voice search is very accurate there are a decent amount of apps for added content i mostly stick to the aforementioned sources but i added tackle for a bit of variety my only complaint would be about the rewind fast forward it s not intuitive and takes some getting used to i don t use that feature often so it s no bigger to me i did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first but i got used to that too just make sure to press the home button when you re done for the evening or whatever because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something it won t go to sleep it remembers your place in whatever you were watching so no worries about that i look forward to continued software improvements and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon so i can try out the games\",\"its the best product its very comfortable to watch shows and read books and alot easy to play games and fun\",\"awesome served my purpose so far this is doing what i wanted it to i purchased it for having alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room at times when i am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command i have to repeat myself louder i usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but i will move it when i have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room i can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it i have to shout the command out to the other room also did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult did take a few tries to pair it i ended up replacing the batteries that were sent with duracell\",\"customer service i m stunned at how bad it was i purchase almost everything with the exception of food from amazon i have been a prime member since the inception of the program without exception i have always received excellent customer service until now i m having difficulty with my fire tv connecting to my wifi last saturday i spent approximately hours maybe troubleshooting with two women tech on the phone mary who i was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise said she thought it wasn t just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on sunday after researching the problem i had no problem with that no call on sunday so i called on monday much to my surprise there was no record of my call attached to my file the rep was confused as to whether i was talking about fire wire or fire tv so i was first sent to a different department finally i got through that fire wire was not the same as fire tv and i was transferred back to digital we went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time i was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice the gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day no call it s tuesday still no call it really pains me to have to say anything negative about amazon s customer service as it has never been less than excellent in the past i ve noticed i haven t gotten a survey as i usually do after a customer service call whoever amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it i m going to wager a bet that there is no record of the hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back i would have had more respect for these reps if i had received a call saying they were sorry but they weren t able to come up with a solution for me i m hoping amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much i ve spent over the years as a loyal customer i m very disappointed that i had to write this review and i m hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves amazon s reputation i can t be the only one receiving this kind of treatment it s obvious that the people who are tech for fire tv are not the same tech that i ve dealt with in the past in fact i don t think they are even in the same country what a pity\",null],\"marker\":{\"color\":\"#CFD8DC\",\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"other\",\"showlegend\":false,\"x\":[5.603594,7.867221,8.87073,5.7484384,5.712055,9.95768,4.6889095,4.525055,6.0563836,5.986618,5.7521067,10.080733,6.07069,6.977705,6.9476748,6.5417285,6.553178,6.707743,10.007255,8.233399,10.064241,5.9576054,6.714892,7.5421576,8.279041,8.262268,8.265841,6.8296566,9.599605,7.067395,10.108666,6.528802,6.7568293,9.611412,4.763467,4.688844,5.566395,5.7016506,6.6997914,7.5362625,5.4173613,6.626387,7.8014817,8.250712,7.537339,6.6080546,5.6477847,6.82771,6.906375,4.693349,6.804853,4.7007723,4.6919394,6.6942396,7.538202,10.766821,10.224567,5.9904814,10.0601015,5.4185863,6.9321632,7.074967],\"y\":[1.6229836,0.34933126,0.9233881,1.7830677,2.0392673,-0.7930193,0.79275423,9.138919,0.59472054,0.6826941,6.209238,-0.81923807,1.33103,0.2690664,0.006294586,-0.4270046,-0.44839546,0.4860096,-0.8260102,0.64553523,-0.66188747,0.8543142,0.85629094,-1.660851,0.431901,0.5492428,0.45780414,-0.62594074,0.35458264,0.5359281,2.0711513,-0.44722974,0.48594552,0.33083516,0.7991049,0.792477,-0.5293392,0.87094665,0.86690044,-1.6721612,0.14740498,0.63323057,0.40596145,0.48009816,-1.6717855,-0.5071067,0.39795437,-0.6283851,0.30077136,0.7924445,-0.63398874,0.7920834,0.7892709,0.8676237,-1.6684399,1.7131374,2.117333,0.13739902,-0.66931766,9.046199,0.48383063,0.6810879],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"great portable echo this is the echo you can take anywhere runs on battery and can connect via bluetooth when away from wifi\",\"excellent sound quality speakers has an excellent quality despite the small size the only disadvantage is the amazon echo feature not present in this one which you can just call alexa and she will answer you in this one as the name says you need to tap the button to wake alexa up\",\"this is a nice compliment to my echo this is a nice compliment to my echo connected to my bt speaker it is actually a step up and less expensive than the echo if i had it to do over again i d have bought of the dots instead\",\"great piece of tech i debated between the tap and echo and this went on sale just before mas for such a great price at best buy that helped to make up my mind pretty quickly\",\"very entertaining new technology in the making i will rate this amazon tap a five stars when the application to make the alexa commands become remote instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself\",\"amazing love this product it is nice looking easy to carry and the sound is amazing very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo nothing to complain about th he speaker itself however the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also one has to take it down just in order to charge\",\"tap when i purchased the tap i thought it was a portable speaker for the echo it s actually it s own device yes it s portable can operate wireless it does work with the same alexa set up the echo operates with no hands you can simply speak to alexa the tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to alexa great sound quality rechargeable base unit\",\"great speaker and portable works great if you plan to have it in arms reach you have to physically tap it to ask alexa store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap not voice activate returned to wait for indefinite out of stock echo to get in eventually\",\"has trouble understanding commands volume control slow to respond as good as the echo is the echo voice remote seems to leave much to be desired whereas the echo dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently the voice remote is far less likely to do so sometimes i m not even heard at all i often have to repeat commands several times before the echo responds to me plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond and i don t mean a milliseconds slow the volume won t change for several seconds after the button is pushed yes this is the new generation voice remote aha you say you must be too far away from the echo dot granted i am on the other side of the house when i use the voice remote however that doesn t explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly every time plus doesn t amazon bag on the device s great range if it was a distance problem wouldn t the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue no either i have a bad remote or the voice remote doesn t work as effectively and effortlessly as the echo dot itself that s too bad update i discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the voice remote but it also comes with a gotha when you press down and hold the talk button on the voice remote it s the equivalent of using the wake word on the echo itself alexa for example since you can t see the led on the echo respond to the wake word the echo makes a tone to let you know that it s listening there is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the talk button the echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question read more\",\"good but missing key feature i understood it did not have the wake command but it would be better if it had it other than that everything is wonderful with this speaker really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps just ask alexa and she plays the most recent episode\",\"excellent sound i have both the echo and the tap they are spectacular\",\"a great assistant it works well it takes time for it to know your vocabulary\",\"greatest thing ever we love this speaker for listening to music the weather news or just anything it is super portable and even has a hands free option so it is really like a mini echo\",\"amazon tap bluetooth alexa great sound and portablebility nice style lithium battery requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news amazon has features available as well i use mine a lot\",\"so so the amazon echo tap is a nice interesting device but it did not fit my needs i also have the amazon echo and absolutely love it so what s the difference a you have to walk up the the tap to touch it this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the echo from across the room b the audio quality not very good more like a small bluetooth speaker c the tap is fine around the house when it s connected to the home wi fi but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi fi that is not going to work very well\",\"the tab is awesome i like its flexibility portability and it is the best value option of all three alexa\",\"my return is like new i love the echo dots i was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up i was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue i have had this unit for about a month now and it has worked perfectly since i received it like a brand new unit if you can get this return for a substantial discount i think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit edit my original return ed echo dot is still going strong and i received my second return ed echo dot yesterday this second one is just as like new as my first one the packaging is similarly like new it has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit and i believe the power adapter cable and manuals are all actually brand new\",\"great sound love alexa it works so well speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does\",\"excellent mobile speakers the amazon tap is a great mobile bluetooth speakers if you are invested in the amazon eco system the produces good sound at all levels plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the echo can do just with mobility added to it as opposed to the echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work\",\"the echo s little sister is amazing important update as you read my original review please be aware that amazon announced in early february a new firmware update that allows amazon tap owners to enable a hands free option by going into settings in the alexa app you can now choose the hands free option and have your tap respond to voice commands without touching it just like the echo and echo dot this is a fabulous development and something tap owners have been hoping for thank you amazon since the lack of hands free operation was the one major shortcomings of the tap this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better one thing to keep in mind though especially if you use your tap on battery power the hands free mode will drain the battery more quickly because it requires the microphone to be on at all times but since you can easily toggle between hands free or regular tap mode using the alexa app you can pick and choose how you want to use your tap for maximum battery life and convenience i admit that i was a little skeptical when amazon first introduced its echo device but i decided to buy one anyway thinking that if i didn t like it i could easily sell it after all back in the early days of the echo it was in very high demand so the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal today as an avid music listener who loves to cook i m thrilled that i decided to give the echo a try i had wanted a device that i could stream music with in the kitchen and the echo hands free voice control made it very appealing but how would it sound that question was quickly answered as soon as i set up and started using my echo read more\",\"love it the tap is a great product access to alexa in a grab and go format\",\"great alexa product the tap is amazing portable and connected to all amazon content\",\"we love this lil thing bought the echo tap echo dot phillips hue starter kit and a honeywell thermostat for my wife for her birthday she loves it and so do i cant wait to add more automated products to it no need to have my phone out tumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature check weather play music etc i just ask alexa to do it while i continue at what i m doing also when the dot and tap are in the same room the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests nice device that will only improve with time\",\"limitations this is a fun and convenient toy but i m surprised about some of the limitations i keep hearing the same npr news clip when i ask for news or headline news i would like more news highlights when i ask for s music echo starts with the same of songs each time\",\"good but not great i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the base mini sounding when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mid and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass\",\"tap is must have for outside once the tap was able to be activated by voice i started to have some interest having said that i notice i do use the tap button when i have it in my hand we use it mostly outside and by our hot tub took is on vacation this last week and use it at the beach using cell phone as an access point\",\"nice addition for echo owners must have for people who have an amazon prime account and an echo portability and water resistant works great by the hot tub or pool and let s you access the normal alexis capabilities\",\"now hands free i wanted to buy a tap when it was first released i have several echo s in the house but having a portable alexa enabled device is awesome unfortunately when it was first released the tap could not be operated hands free i held off purchasing one because i was afraid amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature earlier this year amazon enabled hands free mode and it works almost as well as the echo despite having fewer microphones sound quality is very good it s a small speaker but very capable battery life is excellent this is currently the most flexible implementation of alexa and i recommend it\",\"dissatisfied i have the echo and i bought this one fort my son s room but it s not as user friendly i wish i would ve just bought the other one\",\"the perfect bluetooth speaker plus so much more the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echo and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been crashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the tribe but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of base when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of sir the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof\",\"the extra touch i am thoroughly impressed with my echo dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs a needy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop the construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the echo this case cover will give your echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in but still offer the great functionality of alexa\",\"awesome smart device this is a great addition to my expanding smart home the speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive\",\"echo tap is great i love my echo tap i have my own personal alarm informs me on today s weather forecast and local events great purchase\",\"so much fun this product is awesome you can play your favorite music instantly also had great fun asking alexa questions some serious some funny we love it\",\"great add on to echo i added to a dot purchase for my daughter and she loved it the portability and charge feature she really likes great gift\",\"great product this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hands free mode works just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on projects making shopping lists playing games to turning on the lights i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didn t seem very mobile\",\"very portable this speaker s forte is it s drop and charge ability it does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with the sound quality though is ok def not very loud and lacks the lows but for a small portable speaker which is not expensive i would recommend it\",\"great for home and travel guys the tap does everything echo does and it s portable use it at home for everything at work on your desk for music weather etc and even poolside as a portable speaker\",\"great product i have an amazon echo and an amazon dot love the functionality decent sound for what they are i just wanted something portable for outside\",\"fantastic speaker this is a fantastic little speaker with the power of amazon alexa i use it to stream spotify pandora anderson radio small speaker fills the garage like a concert hall battery last hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use\",\"great look for dot a great looking cover for the echo dot it gives the dot a softer and more elegant look i feel that it is a little price for what you get but i do not regret my decision to buy this case\",\"the echo is great the echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you ll want them for all over your house\",\"nice however thoughts of being able to have the echo grow as i added to the list of tasks excited me including the latest app having it to recognize my smartphone s contact list to place and to receive calls however the echo i purchased does not link up to my samsung smartphone disappointed is a understatement\",\"i would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn t this is not the same remote that i got for my alexa echo it doesn t control volume i think remote most used feature is volume and pause i would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn t control volume that would make me an incompetent engineer or lazy ceo amazon i expect better from you\",\"the tap i have the echo and i just love it i bought the tap for my daughter for christmas so she does not know she has it yet\",\"amazon tap best portable speaker i ve ever owned i use this everyday mostly when getting ready in the morning or when i have guests over good sound quality and links to the alexa app just like an echo it come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the echo also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord\",\"great item i ve enjoyed using the features alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers the sound quality is good\",\"great speaker this is not like the amazon echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good but you will lose bass if it s at max volume not recommended if you like bass\",\"no magnetic bolster but remote is same the remote seems to function as the previous generation but the lack of a magnetic bolster is a major disappointment having a place to park the remote was such a fantastic feature at first the echo came with a remote and bolster then i had to buy a remote separately with my second echo but it still came with the bolster now i have to buy the remote for another echo and a dot and they don t have the holders rather than raising the price or at least offering a choice i feel like the quality is being stripped down with each new generation i still like the echoes okay they fill a need but i am worried about amazon s choices in slowly cutting away the extras\",\"great product with a ton of features great product with a ton of features add the echo dot to get even more out of it\",\"useful info and fun to have around alexa speaking from the amazon tap is great to have around current news personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from alexa the tap sits next to my bed on the site stand where i can easily call up info from my bed or as i walk by during the day or site especially useful for a review of my calendar so i can review my upcoming days plans try alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house\",\"its ok for the price i prefer spending the extra or to get the echo\",\"versatile device with superior sound tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound ai app alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool\",\"best i ever spent so i don t normally write reviews but i just has to this time recently i lost my cat best friend to cancer days after christmas it was the worst day of my life imagine losing your friend that s been with you through every breakup every apartment nearly being homeless and more when he passed i felt such an emptiness in my home a few days ago i was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the amazon echo on the amazon app i remember watching a mr robot episode where some fbi agent who suffers from insomnia was using alexa to keep her entertained so i started researching youtube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it it arrived today and the setup was super easy i immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news then i discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and i completely fell in love with it it s almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down it suggested new music which i actually liked and the built in speaker isn t bad at all for the price the amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat rough but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now i added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like i would totally recommend buying this product i don t see any negatives other than the fact you can t really ask it followup questions like google assistant but i m sure they ll make it happen thanks for letting me rant\",\"great for those new to bluetooth didn t want to spend on the echo for someone who s not use to using a bluetooth speaker great buy and functions well\",\"maybe i was expecting more i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen i m a big fan of alexa the products have become a routine part of my day as soon as the show was available to preorder i ordered one without any hesitation initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv where my original echo was i figured it wouldn t look bad because i could use it as a digital picture frame also i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because most of my alexa enabled devices are in there and generally i spend more time in my living room than the kitchen the problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on if you have a larger kitchen so if you aren t standing directly in front of it it s hard to view the screen you will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you as far as i can tell you can not cut the screen off completely which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom the clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen update the screen can be cut off this device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes my frustration is when i ask it to pull up a recipe it s inconsistent sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone sometimes it wants me to swine down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients read more\",\"amazon echo tap this is my second echo purchase my first was the original echo for my home and the automation feature aside the sound is excellent alexa s response is better than any digital assistant to date and the ready access to prime is convenient this is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well additionally the inclusion of bluetooth and a headphones jack is amazing\",\"wow i was impressed with the sound of the original echo the price of the dot the echo tap is the best of both and portable i have echo in multiple rooms i got this to bring music outside to the patio the music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk now that siriusxm is on alexa too i have access to great music howard stern nfl mlb and all the rest of the satellite radio content the great thing about the tap is unlike a normal bluetooth speaker this one works solo with alexa and wifi even my wife loves it i think she talks to alexa now more than she talks to me\",\"perfect to play music this speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that i am in the tap is annoying compared to the echo with voice activation but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it\",\"handy speaker if you don t need the best sound if you already have the amazon echo system then the tap is a nice addition i use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice there are bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker the real advantage is being able to interface with the echo system as well as item to music news etc i have not used it off it s charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem\",\"best echo available the amazon echo show is a voice activated device you can instruct it to play video content play music stream online audio order products and services and control home automation products the echo show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen which in my opinion greatly enhances the use and potential of this device ive been using this device for a few days so far below you will find some of my initial impressions what i like good build quality the show has a nice bright screen that has good viewing angles good sound the speakers on the show sound much better than the original echo easy setup setup was extremely easy mostly due to the shows touch screen after making a few selections the show was up and running in no time content suggestions when you aren t interacting with the show it continuously displays content suggestions i like that it will suggest videos to watch video content i like being able to view amazon video video news briefings movie trailers and youtube videos on the show video calling video calling works as advertised i like being able to initiate a call with my voice music with lyrics when playing songs from amazon music you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen home automation like other echo the show can control your smart home products the show has the extra ability to display camera feeds on screen apps the echo can display my calendar reminders lists timers local weather and more because of this i find the show infinitely more useful than the original echo what i don t like the show needs more functionality that beverages the touch screen read more\",\"great extension of echo this worked well as an extension of the amazon echo to cover our basement living area\",\"alexa bluetooth speaker whether you just want the weather latest sports scores or help with a math problem alexa will help we now have in the house and will be adding two more with a simple subscription to amazon s music service you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking alexa for it perfect work with my meldung qq chocolate bluetooth speaker i also recommend this speaker meldung universal water resistance chocolate portable v wireless bluetooth speaker with w dual driver and built in microphoneand use this code for less have yf i got it from somewhere else for the paranoid this device is not for you the echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device alexa amazon or echo your choice there are enough times that i hear one in another room say sorry i did not understand the question to tell me it misunderstand these prompts to have been said when they weren t pretty often good product support good voice recognition because of the size it doesn t stand out like a sore thumb in a room doesn t differentiate between voices if you keep it closer to a speaker than you are then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given placement of dot is crucial for a good experience only supports english and german for now not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality read more\",\"tap it is a great addition to my home office my alexa is upstairs\",\"love it love it need to get some smart appliances i also got the echo dot wish i got these items sooner\",\"great item i love this little speaker it is small enough to carry it wherever i want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard the alexa interface is pretty cool as well the only issue for me is that it doesn t connect with apple music this issue is easily resolved by putting tap in bluetooth mode and playing apple music through my phone to the tap\",\"great on the go speaker this is a great on the go speaker i like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in also bonus alex i like the update they have done to it as well where you don t have to push the button to activate her you can just say her name if you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much choose this one spend more m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound but you can t travel with it\",\"tap tap is a nice bluetooth wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions can sync with your phone via using the amazon alexa app\",\"overall good i bought this to listen to music i do not use the alexa feature all that much the feature does work great but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak the speakers work great i can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it bass is decent i would recommend to someone\",\"portability it s nice and portable and works well on the go wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button\",\"ok product would buy the cheaper one than i bought the echo is a better product\",\"awesome speaker with alexa i wanted to get a portable bluetooth speaker that i could use while out as well as at home the tap has great sound quality and alexa is more useful than i would have thought\",\"updated they re great have several now updated so useful we now have of these along with the full sized echo amazon echo blackafter using the full sized echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware i had no experience with the dot so i went ahead and stopped for the refurbished a first as well the dot arrived in a small plain box upon removal found the dot to look just like new no blemishes cuffs wings nothing whatsoever to indicate based on appearance it was anything other than new it comes with plug usb charging cable that said what matters most is how it functions i was concerned being refurbished but no worries it worked just as good as new the device works exactly the same as the full sized echo for myself the biggest difference was the addition of a mm aux out jack while you can pair both this and its larger big brother to any bluetooth speaker i have a set of wired base headphones and needed that extra bit so i could use them too how do the dot full sized echo compare differences are surprisingly few as said the dot has a mm jack so you can use it with any wired speaker headphones or earbuds while the echo does not the dot when listening to speech or low volumes other sounds very good and at the same volume level i could not tell a difference between either of the two however at higher volumes the dot struggles with the larger echo easily winning out otherwise but for appearance they both function the same as for what the echo or smaller version dot can dread more\",\"amazon tap brings a new meaning to portable music amazon echo is great but it is stuck at home amazon tap on the other hand goes everywhere in the short time we have had ours we have brought it to sweden portugal the lake up north and friend s houses it has served as a music host at card games answered questions and added things to our shopping list it is easy to set up amazon tap to a wifi network using the alexa app on your smartphone you can also easily pair several devices to the tap via bluetooth what really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated new skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis amazon really hit home with the tap as the voice interface is so easy to use and the portability makes it a great\",\"great speaker great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app\",\"great tool for quick information unlike the larger version this does not need to be plugged in making it portable although you have to press the button for every request it s great to take with you where ever you go fully rechargeable\",\"nice alternative to the echo the tap is essentially a smaller version of the echo that has alexa capability like echo does but also doubles as a portable bluetooth speaker you do need to tap it to ask alexa to do anything but otherwise it works the same as echo i prefer the echo but the tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their echo\",\"great product for price you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it plays all my music\",\"okay sound i returned it because i wanted better sound opted for a base sounding decent speaker with nice amazon prime alexa features just not the sound i was looking for\",\"a huge improvement over last years release and for half the price thanks for taking the time to read this review this re release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam although slightly smaller then last years release this device now picks up your voice even better im talking literally talking leaps and bounds better i can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im bearing music thru my harmony pardon on speaker i found myself yelling at last years echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen we will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi room voice recognition technology amazon claims to have installed a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices so basically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note the basic amazon music unlimited will only work on one of your devices not one at a time but one if you want to use it on more than one dot or echo you have to purchase a multi device plan https www amazon com gp music promotions amazonmusicunlimited the main selling point of this device is you can use any of your existing bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar or you can use the mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating at your own risk of course i have both the amazon tap and the echo unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction hence the bluetooth and the mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the picket of listeners to appreciate their music thru existing devices read more\",\"great product works just like echo but portable great stuff as described\",\"great portable alexa we have had the full size echo for over a year and i love it the tap requires you to push the button before alexa responds to your requests so that takes a little getting used to after using the big echo s voice activated requests the tap speaker is not as good as the big echo but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge overall i really like this and i found it at best buy for\",\"remote is a great addition remote is a great addition i have two echo s and two dots which i use for my home automation they work great my only issue is that amazon is no longer shipping the magnetic holder with the echo felt this was a very helpful and welcomed addition which helped me organize my remote safely this is the only reason i am giving it stars c mon amazon you are charging the same price as the older remote labelling it new generation and eliminating the magnetic holder disappointing\",\"great companion i have the have the echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home especially if i m working in the garage and want to listen to music\",\"uber awesome in fact you can even order an uber ride from it love our new echo i have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features last person i talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and amazon prime day was the perfect opportunity to go for it amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info training command center there are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that i ll hit the highlights that work for our household first we love that it follows your voice in the room the circle lighting will show which direction it is listening the speaker is wonderfully balanced so whether listening to music the news or to alexa speaking i have nothing but high marks for its sound quality given its size next set up after downloading the app to our phones was quick easy and very intuitive the more you look over the app the more you will realize a world of skills as amazon refers to them we ve picked named them echolettes lol that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initiative them we ve added things to shopping lists while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked alexa to change the temp of our nest thermostats in various parts of the house simply by saying her name and then our commands sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through she is always there listening and ready we ve ordered some led programmable lights and i can hardly wait for alexa to help set the mood in the house room to room all from a simple voice request read more\",\"the best of both bt and voice used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how i can use spotify with it just say alexa and ask for your favorite artist\",\"would be better with dot good sound but unlike echo you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do i ordered a dot so this may solve that issue\",\"good product and good sale price gave as a gift did not know you had to tap it before you talk thought it was like echo anyway they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk really likes that it is battery powered portable\",\"coolest high tech gadget i love my new toy alexa is my personal girl friday she understands what i want and retrieves it easy to set up and use\",\"some nice surprises this was a birthday gift from my daughter st birthday certified old guy what might i do with an echo i bought a kindly book on using an echo later i discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what i need to search out and a kindly book makes it easy for me to make notes i can find later with ease i am using my echo primarily as a radio in the early s i worked on my german skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio most of that is now on the internet i could listen on my smart phone but that uses phone battery reserves the echo runs on ac power from a wall outlet the little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts i listen for hours to german news magazines i can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from radio canada we live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial but our wifi reaches my garage workshop and i have clear audio through tune in i am having trouble linking heart radio perhaps because my subscription is not paid when i have asked alexa a question she sometimes tells me she can not answer a question i thought simple enough i did ask for some music and was surprised to find cds i bought as gifts are in amazon s cloud for me to hear over echo nice\",\"love alexa love alexa we currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis i use one at work basically for streaming music great device no problems connecting to any of them\",\"already very practical for overcoming disability issues we have been using echo since april prior to that time my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks he is currently wheelchair bound we immediately installed the hue bridge and lights as well as the demo outlet with these and dear dear alexa he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent others might enjoy echo for fun and convenience but for him it is a lifeline he has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when i didn t hear him call we use the shopping list feature a lot and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered while i was already at the store should i mention he adds things like chocolate bars when i m not looking no more paper lists i just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as i check them off we transport echo from the living room to the bedroom since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote plus it is always there for his favorite music an update on news and to check the weather or when he needs cheering up i ask for a joke save plugging in behind his lift chairs i have ordered a second plug i love the easy reconnect to the wifi i was a bit worried at first about his word blurring with his parkinson s but it has worked the opposite way i notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands after he forgot her name early on we added it so he could remember using the link happy app my granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using echo and in addition to the music stations and amazon play lists echo is a breeze to use as a bluetooth device i have used it to play my meditation apps and itunes music read more\",\"echo tap overall for an alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones this one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging the one main issue is that it is not voice activated meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front by having this feature i could see it causing excess battery usage needs to be able to apps better\",\"great gadget it was an unexpected gift i like this more than the alexa because this one is portable it s great for streaming music my kids use it all the time only problem so far is it does not always understand what i m saying especially when saying the name of a radio station sometimes takes few tries before i get what i m looking for it has great sound when playing music talk radio is not as good but understandable if you want a portable speaker and alexa this is the one to get\",\"it s all about alexa but not about that bass works great to control alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes gets very loud at least easily connects to bluetooth\",\"amazon tap its very nice and not as big as the echo didn t know there was a tap available to buy\",\"great speaker great product i love this product and that you can take alexa everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker you can connect it to your phone when away from a wifi building the speaker is great it is surrounded by cloth which i would worry about it getting dirty the one downside to the tap compared to the echo dot or the og echo is that alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the tap you have to press the speaker button pretty self explanatory name you have to tap the tap i ended up returning it to get the dot but like i said great speaker great portable device\",\"alexa is great plays all my ipod music via bluetooth also plays radio stations you can t get on a regular radio very practical and fun\",\"they missed on this one having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do\",\"awesome device w alexa features same features as echo now but easier to move around the house as needed w you\",\"love it great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go love that this stream and plays prime music battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best\",\"i love being able ask questions of alexa this is a nice item i can set reminders get news and weather all by the tap of a button\",\"a great portable speaker and more works as well as the echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good easy to move around in and out of the house will work anywhere you have wifi if you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive echo\",\"my kids know alexa this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family\",\"great product for the price this amazon is amazing just like the echo but smaller i show everyone how great it is\",\"great product alexa works great and does lots of things for you fun for the family\",\"great purchase the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable\",\"amazon tap is great amazon tap is a great device the device has very good audio quality despite it s small size the biggest difference between this and the larger amazon echo is that you have to press the microphone button before the device will listen to you which is great for people who are concerned that the echo is always listening to what you say so far the battery life has been great with the alexa app it is very easy to connect this device to different wi fi networks\",\"not bad echo sounds better for music but tap gives me portability good to have both now tap is voice activated so it s all good\",\"great baby alexa pleased with all the features amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inns small package\",\"the best echo yet especially if you have elderly parents this was really worth the wait i bought the echo show for my parents who are elderly and have a variety of ailments since they have arthritis and a few other issues i didn t want them to go and answer the doorbell just to find it s someone soliciting them to buy random junk so last year i bought and installed the ring doorbell pro in their house which works very well the ring doorbell pro is hardware and not battery operated after the skill was enabled i could tell alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up you really need a good wi fi router with the echo show as the video will be jerk since the video is very high quality if you have a good wi fi router the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth i thought the doorbell would launch the app on the echo show automatically but it does not you have to initiate the connection yourself hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill i can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do but for a very first implementation it works great with the hardware version of the ring doorbell pro the battery powered ring products do not work as great though when trying to connect the echo show to a battery powered ring device i get a message saying something like the camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take sec this happens with my ring stick camera so if you want the best experience you should buy the ring doorbell pro instead of the battery powered versions one of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn t have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call so we have another echo show just for her in drop in mode read more\",\"nice addition to the echo lineup i bought the tap to integrate with the echo it is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact alexa the wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect\",\"i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap ok first things first i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the tap was voice enabled like the echo i happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through because the echo is not meant to be a mobile device it generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have but the tap is meant to be mobile and therefore i am happy it s not a voice command device i would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it so i actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature i have the echo on my kitchen counter and the tap in my studio office and when i leave my office i just grab it and go i bought this on sale for and i went to the store and listened to many bluetooth speakers and while yes the charge sounds better all the charge can do is be a bluetooth speaker while the tap is so much more for less and the tap sounds great after looking online i was a little nervous that it would not sound that great but i was wrong about that there is no other product out there for that sounds this good and can do what the tap does i was not paid or given a tap to write this review i m just a consumer who was it the market for a bluetooth speaker and i could not be happier with my choice also if you buy this device buy the amazon sling as well trust me you will want it and honestly i am again happy i got the one that covers the bottom of the tap because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink i would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed that s it that s all buy it you won t be disappointed\",\"better sound than expected was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone doesn t need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our echo dot but was pleasant surprised with the sound quality and volume we prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker and its hands free mode is a great updated feature though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster\",\"alexa is charming and reasonably intelligent amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the aws engine behind it there s a lot of opportunity for development both from the community as well as amazon naturally they favor interaction with services they sell so others will need to build links to others but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already the price of this tap was outstanding adding it to my existing echo and now considering a dot\",\"i was excited but i was really excited for this speaker got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go then i listened to the music it has no bass if you want something the has a good range of sound this isn t it it is focused on treble only no low end i ended up getting the bl charge love it\",\"great overpriced alarm clock if you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device it works well calendar functions plays radio most podcasts can order domino s but you have to be aware that most features require to some degree amazon prime membership for example spotify will not work unless it is a premium account\",\"excellent the echo is great for music weather and anything else you have integrated in the house\",\"best voice command that doesn t list all the time this product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations while it is an option i prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command that way its not listening till i tell it to unlike google s device and the other amazon devices\",\"very well built i have a few top end bluetooth speakers and this amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in\",\"another one already have a few other alexa wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker works as expected\",\"impulse buy i should have done some research before buying the tap i would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated also i thought it would be more like sir where you can ask anything alexa s answer to most questions is i don t understand the question the bluetooth speaker works fine\",\"five stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no fits beautifully sung and sweet\",\"now i have a tap too i have the echo and a dot and now the tap too my only issue with the tap is that i got it after the echo this means that by the time i got the tab i was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my echo of course with the tap you have to physically get up and touch the tap i think if i had first started out with the tap and having to touch it it wouldn t be so difficult now for me remember to tap the tap but it is a habit to just call out now so i wish i d gotten the tap first and then had graduated to the echo try the tap first you might decide you don t even need an echo you definitely won t be disappointed\",\"the smartest of them all check out the video for a quick demo having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now i ve seen scores of smart devices come and go until now nobody quite got it right in the echo dot amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software i ve seen plenty of the former but truly seamless multi platform software has ended everyone but amazon we re talking major players like samsung and google who have been at it for much longer than amazon the main problem is that excellent products like the samsung smart things hub which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies nest honeywell phillips and so on still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support i wanted so i d still end up needing my tablet or phone thanks to fantastic third party support the dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music order food check the weather listen to the radio set alarms and timers all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands to me this is the exceedingly rare product that i didn t know i needed and now can t live without similar to the smartphone and tablet i use every day that didn t exist just a few short years ago if you re even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be update after a bit more time with the dot or maybe i should say dots since i went out and bought another one for my living room i ve come up with a few tips use the best speakers you can with it i found that while bluetooth was convenient i got much better sound out of my bl duet computer speakers take the time to voice train alexa at least once read more\",\"major security flaw my amazon echo dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth i live in an apartment complex two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part the dot appears as a parable bluetooth device at all times this is a major security flaw considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account and is listening at all times i will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed\",\"great alexa for on the go this is great for the beach or by the pool if you already own an echo this is a great addition to the household\",\"very good product this is a very good product the speakers are good the price was right i liked everything about it other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it unlike the echo and the dot the portability was good but i didn t have much use for it being portable unless you are going to keep the tap within arm s reach you re better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products recommended with caveats\",\"a nice buy this has all the benefits of the echo for a slightly better price i also love the portability\",\"great tech bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc\",\"i love it with one exception it s as good as an echo great sound nice and loud but but the button that button i would give this stars and buy more of them if it was always listening while plugged in other than that it does everything an echo does it s smaller and due to the battery portable i like it i do but it s not as useful as the echo in the situation i use it the most\",\"not as great as the echo i wouldn t buy it again the software doesn t seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i don t have the same connectivity issues with it that i do with this i liked the features available with this portability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issues i can t say i would recommend it i have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered i am not the only one that feels this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing\",\"great source of info this alexa is a super form of info with little wait time\",\"great product love the speaker and the assistance of alexa was trying to choose between this and a regular bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs\",\"good companion to echo overall sound is not as good as echo my primary source for amazon content however the tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock it s portability sets it apart however it s nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting recent software update now allows listening mode it does require a brief pause after saying alexa wake word but it does work this drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button the portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my echo which is fabulous\",\"perfect to listen to music bought the tap for my mom to primarily listen to music although my mom forgets the girl s name haha we ve found alexa will answer without saying her name the rechargeable base is nice so the tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi sound is great too pleased\",\"outstanding price point an emotional moment and the power of alexa ordering more today i am a prime member this was my first purchase of echo and i gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it haha i purchased echo dot for reasons i had wanted the original echo but thought the near price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and i wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately i want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is instantly high but she has always been resistant to change she had no wifi in her bedroom but i resolved that when i purchased tp link av wi fi range extended overline edition which did what no other wifi extended i purchased in past could do gave my mom s room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines all i know is that she now has wifi in her room so i got echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool i easily connected echo to tp link and it worked we asked alexa a few basic questions we laughed a little but then i had to leave when i returned the next day i walked in and there was music playing oldies but bodies and i walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional i asked her if everything was ok she was in awe she was happy she was emotional because alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me the speed that alexa found the song and played it was mind bowling mom was also planning a dinner in august and needed to know what day of week it was she would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calendar in the kitchen and find the date but this time she just asked alexa who gave her the information in like seconds lol read more\",\"great portable version of echo can charge and take anywhere in the house holds a long charge\",\"alexa works good but alexa works great but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible your much better off with a echo dot and base sound link mini set up\",\"great product this speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it s got the alexa application\",\"amazon echo with portable bluetooth speaker always loved the amazon echo now we can rake it with us outside wherever\",\"day review i liked my echo i like my echo show even more first day with the echo show i m pretty pleased with it some observations that i think have not been hit in most reviews sound quality seems similar to that of the echo cylinder good for a desktop listening experience not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound the show does have an ambient light sensor using the camera so that the screen dies as the room lighting goes down when i darkened the room at night to work at my pc the show display dammed to the point where i could just make out the time and not the background photo at all much has been made of the show displaying lyrics when playing prime music that doesn t appeal to me but when playing music from spotify pandora and my music on amazon the show displays the song title artist name album art and a progress indicator that s really nice when listening to playlists i was always asking my echo cylinder alexa what s that song alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my pandora channels with the show if alexa doesn t recognize the name i can ask it to display my pandora channels and select them fro the show touch screen it s good to have a fullback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the alexa app then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection some newsfeed are now accompanied by appropriate photographs you can set the show to use an album from amazon prime photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive again other photo servers can not be used\",\"greatest invention ever this is one of the coolest new inventions around it is very innovative and works great it s really neat asking alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored\",\"like echo without voice prompts i have an echo tap and a dot currently my tap serves as a bluetooth speaker for my dot making it more like the echo but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere it has really good sound much like my echo it also works great in the app and sync with all my other products\",\"i enjoy using this speaker at work at home it has sleep timer capability alarm i use it at work or use it at home while i m in the shower and i ll bring it to friends houses and we use alexa to gain information or just have fun quality a its loud too\",\"love my echo tap love having the wireless tap to use anywhere it s small sound is good charges up quickly bought the sling to protect it outside\",\"great speaker this is a great personal speaker i have both the tap and the echo the only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically tap the mic button to activate alexa the sound quality is pretty good for the price if you can afford it i would upgrade to the echo\",\"tap fills a gap that didn t need filling this product while the speaker is great fails to deliver with a voice interface use your cell phone or computer and buy an echo dot\",\"love the tap this is awesome addition to the stationary echo i can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside great sound and long battery\",\"great item for beginners great product for intro to an ai device cant wait to upgrade to echo\",\"love my tap it s not the echo but for what i paid it s well worth every penny\",\"alexa at the tap of your finger love all the features that come with this speaker alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot above average sound on the go and got a great deal on it\",\"got me hooked best buy was running a sale on these and i thought i d give it a try i wasn t expecting much but was pleasant surprised i m an apple guy so sir has been my go to virtual assistant i must say that i am duly impressed with alexa she seems to understand me better than sir does all the skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great the fact that this is all available in a portable device that i can take with me everywhere i go is so useful the tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so i can use it anywhere unlike its non portable brother the echo you push a button to issue commands to alexa on the plus side you don t have to say alexa on the negative side you still have to push the button i understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if alexa was listening all the time amazon should issue a firmware update to allow alexa to listen all the time when plugged in the sound quality is good not great other speakers in the category sound better but none have all the convenience of alexa bluetooth wifi and portability in one package i ll be buying more as christmas gifts\",\"not a bad product but the button is annoying i got the wrong one plain and simple it does what it says and i like the connection to the internet to play music but i should have gotten the echo i get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button\",\"great pop of color for a bland looking product changes the whole look of the echo after i purchased i think i should have gone with the tan leather but blue is my favorite color and it adds a bit of a pop to a mundane looking black disk the texture is also really nice feel and look to it\",\"fun and useful with great sound as a bluetooth speaker the tap rocks the sound quality is excellent plenty loud when needed and excellent quality with no shutters in streaming i bought this one instead of the echo because it is portable and i can lug it from room to room the charging stand is very convenient and the tap stays there most of the time having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me but is something to consider if you want hands free use you may want the big brother echo device which is hands free but gathered in place by a power cord so not portable the feel of the tap with the black fabric cover is nice and will not slip out of your hand the fabric is like tough upholstery cover so it won t stain or be easy to damage but is quite attractive i am glad they did that as bare plastic would be easy to drop i found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless and it works as advertised i mostly just use it for playing music and asking alexa silly questions for fun i occasionally use it for shopping lists which shows up on my phone and checking the weather who knows what the future holds when i have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do i understand that amazon plans to add more alexa skills all the time and if one got into smart house control with compatible products the tap would eliminate all remote which i already have too many of i think it is a really fun cool item and i am glad i got it it is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing especially the tiny smart phone typing i could get used to this i have the alexa app on my phone which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone like shopping lists to do lists calendar the tap can also check traffic weather movies etc directly through wi fi no phone needed however the alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the tap the tap can read audible and some kindly ebooks to you as well btw i haven t had any problems having it understand me which is amazing since i grew up in texas and expected a problem with my accent obviously this item is ideal for people who are amazon prime members so you can stream prime music although it also streams pandora and other music services and does many things without any connection to amazon i guess the most unique thing about the tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly without a computer or phone driving it that and the voice control i have paid more for smaller just bluetooth speakers so to me this was a super deal and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment\",\"provides excellent protection for my new tap that is out and about with me as we speak sling is simply awesome and so is the amazon tap my tap arrived this morning along with this sling and i am currently testing both products out as we speak this sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today one nice thing i like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition it provides great protection for the tap which is what i needed it for my tap is going to be like a mini portable songs for me it s going to be a speaker i take with me daily so i wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting winged up even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker it still protects it from wings the minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker taking the speaker to the beach camping hiking to parties i wanted something to protect it while in use this sling is going to do just that another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag at first i was afraid the silicone wouldn t be strong enough for that and would stretch well so far no issues i use a carbine and attach it to my bag no stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me pros can access all buttons in the sling can charge with the sling on via usb port not dock allows personalization of your tap protects your tap from wings and since my tap isn t for home use this is great i love the bright and vibrant colors silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging doesn t adversely affect sound qualityoverall i do feel for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap i very happy with it i didn t buy my tap to sit still at home read more\",\"two thumbs up alexa works great it was easy to set up and to us my wife uses it for playing music through her iphone and is very happy with it i am always finding and learning new things with alexa\",\"so far so good i do like the portability of my tap you do lose some features from the echo like speaking to it from across the room but i m happy with it and it has good sound great to take out by the pool\",\"great for music and more bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she loves it great music player with all the great alexa capabilities opted for the tap because i m a bit weary of the echo always listening\",\"great sound and cheaper than the echo i love everything about it it is portable sounds better than most portable speakers and alexa rocks it only thing that kept it from a star rating is that you have to manually activate alexa wish it would work like the echo and dot while it is on its base\",\"as a prime member this is ideal for me i have grown very accustomed to having alexa around there are new skills added on a very regular basis i really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song radio station podcast to be played i also enjoy having books read to me since i m not much of a reader the setup was super simple so simple that i wasn t sure that i was all ready to go with such minimal effort the battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine i feel that there is a bright future for the tap and i am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer i m not sure i needed this item but i can t imagine not having it around now so pleased with this purchase\",\"alexa house before i bought this i had a blue tooth speaker and an ipod touch both of which had to be charged and turned on etc now i just tell alexa to play music\",\"great sound in a portable bluetooth and more i bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from base and beats i purchased this one because it had great sound but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via alexa voice control i love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice it s great than i can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs playlists volume etc the alexa voice recognition works very well it seems to be more accurate than sir i frequently ask alexa what song is playing i also ask alexa to search for certain songs that i want to hear if not in my library it will play from prime music similar to the way apple music functions additional voice features i use are news reports weather forecasts and control of demo switches in my home overall a great buy\",\"portable good sound i like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice you can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say alexa\",\"i love alexa hi everyone alexa is the best of the best i feel like she knows me more and more each week she is a strong speaker for my love of music she knows like everything ever i ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something she does struggle a little with recent events but that will get better with time she is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar in a word awesome\",\"great fun for the family from latest news flash to weather info to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for alexa to set a timer the amazon tap is a fun tool to have around the house\",\"unable to rate at this time purchased as a gift but i do have the echo if the echo works like the echo it will be great\",\"great buy great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use\",\"love it i have the echo and bought this one for the bedroom great alarm clock\",\"great fun i love it i can t say enough about the amazon tap i enjoy playing music from it and that it s portable i can play music from my amazon prime account pandora or from my phone it is fun to ask alexa questions yes alexa can not answer all my questions or find everything i ask for but it is still amazing\",\"she loves it echo dot in my pmc sierra detail at first she was just there with no support she sat in that hole with no protection shifting juggling not knowing what can happen there has to be something i can do i looked and search and what i found is the fabric case for alexa this is it a support she will be happy to wear no more accidental popping out no more shifting and adjusting she is finally safe\",\"my new found friend i have missed my pandora since i moved from ft worth tx to colorado a few months ago my nephew had the amazon tap and i was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it saying alexa tell mini their grandmother to go to bed and it did and the sound and quality of music coming from it awesome i had to have one so i went to local best buy and bought it i even set it up myself i m so was impressed with myself lol but i have listened nonstop to s music or music from dirty dancing which i loved i have ordered a little case from amazon com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room which i have been doing i feel like i have a new found friend love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as base in my book get it you ll love it i do very very pleased with it weather updates here or where my kids are just checking no interruptions or commercials when listening all day long\",\"great i returned alexa and love it i first bought alexa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking\",\"another win for amazon a nice complement to the alexa family the sound quality is nearly as good as the original echo and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by particularly for the price\",\"alexa is the best this little speaker is way better that her mother after that update making it hand free i recommend to anyone\",\"great dumb speaker i was looking for a butmoth speaker to use with my phone but i didn t want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months this speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by alexa and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound the speaker quality is great for a portable option the only thing that i don t like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right but i can t knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem\",\"awesome speaker has great sound clarity alexa has great responses\",\"didn t work this review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me i would put it down just upgraded to the echo instead of the tap\",\"gift product i bought one for myself and a couple as gifts it s cute but still haven t figured out what s so great about it i will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room\",\"neat little speaker this gico is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the alexa world\",\"alexa love the sound that comes out and alexa is very informative\",\"amazing smaller then what i expecting alexa sounds loud and clear music sounds great just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button\",\"returned it while it seemed to work fine the tap does not have the open mic feature while that can be best for some i bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens the tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with alexa which seems to defeat the purpose\",\"ok for what it is if you want a tap to make use of amazon s alexa voice services then dont get one the tap is a fine enough bluetooth speaker for wireless music but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable\",\"great for what it does look at this product as a portable speaker first and an echo replacement second the big reason to buy this over standard bluetooth speakers is this has wifi streaming enabled when you are at home you can stream music with ease to it voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories the only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice if you want bigger sound and always listening features spend the extra money on the amazon echo\",\"alexa is most for every house hold i got one for my mom she s years young and she sits and listens to it all day she s got the amazon tap i got my daughter the dot and i got my self another tap i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better my grand kids love playing games with alexa like i said every household need one\",\"fabulous speaker looked at the echo before we bought this and i would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable this has everything we need and then some\",\"great wireless speaker easy setup love that its wireless and its fun talking to alexa as she gives excellent information\",\"very good bluetooth speaker very easy to setup and use still learning to maximize the usage the instruction is too simple and not cover much using alexa\",\"met all my expectations smart timely very effective around the house i have a dot as well but the tap has much better sound i had a google earth and replaced it with the tap because google was not as smart as happy\",\"not perfect but does a great job picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage love that it s battery powered never had an issue of it running out of juice the only issue i have is with the misc it doesn t respond to your voice as well as the echo or dot then again it wasn t really designed to listen for the alexa command since it originally required you to tap the speaker to get it to listen\",\"alexa i absolutely love my amazon echo it is very convenient and handy\",\"privacy alexa awesome if you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant then this is the product for you the tap only listens to your when you push the button otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings you get the awesome power of alexa provided by amazon and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously\",\"nice bt wifi speaker product is great does a good job at interpreting voice commands every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection\",\"great start to a smart home the amazon tap is the first step into making your home a smart home it will act as a brain to everything else unfortunately you ll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights thermostat locks etc to get the full potential out of it alone it merely acts as a bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone\",\"great sound best sounding amazon speaker hands down the only annoyance is that it keeps after the alexa wake word and after the command unlike the other echo i have with no obvious way to turn this off other than that sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere\",\"nice amazon product i have owned the echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides although the tap doesn t have the hands free feature of the echo i like its portability i m able to take it outdoors at home and using the wifi play music or even use the other features available by just asking alexa the unit is well built and i really like the charging cradle provided\",\"awesome i added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house i don t like that you have to tap it to activate\",\"great price good product i have owned three versions of the amazon echo the original the dot and the tap this is the most versatile of the three the wireless charging is great the sound is not as good as the original but the portability makes up for this at it was a fantastic buy\",\"she was a beautiful lady here on earth and i am sure she i have been using advanced technology for the last years it was born out of necessity not convenience my wife passed away years ago leaving me not only a widow but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own we were married years and yes she married me when i was already paralyzed she was a beautiful lady here on earth and i am sure she is just as beautiful in god s presence i have to attest that it has been an arduous journey but one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though i am paralyzed from the chest down is smart technology for example i am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone computer or tablet i have lights electric door locks electric bed air conditioning heat cameras both indoor and out side smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when i am laying in bed i can not use my arms when i am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis up to this point i have used input through joystick that operate by using my mouth they work effectively but the joystick must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my year old mother whose health is due to god s grace and technology now stable and she is actually helping me more each day alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination she has given me an opportunity that i never thought would be possible i still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to wi fi disruption but alexis is growing more dependable each day at this point i have only an echo dot but i am ordering when funds allow the regular echo and another dot as well read more\",\"so much fun for traveling i have an alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling you can use this without a plug in cord\",\"we like it haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it\",\"i have the original echo and love it i have put the dot in the bedroom where my echo is in the living area my family uses her for everything enjoy everything about the echo dot\",\"great device i am in love with the alexa tap this is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest i would recommend to all\",\"portable interactive entertainment i was debating whether to get the stationary alexa device or the tap and decided on portability it s been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we re on a roll i use it for play lists at work alarm clock announcement by dan marino and news briefs it s surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so i could take it with me while fishing\",\"great product this is the best of both worlds a reasonably priced bt speaker and an amazon alexa enabled device i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a bt speaker and considering an alexa enabled device\",\"maybe i was expecting more initially i gave the echo show a star rating in all fairness after about days of use i ve decided to change my score and here s why first off amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice i appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device i ve also noticed quite a few updates in the short time i ve had my show and honestly things are changing for the better i ve been updating my review and will continue to do so as i ve noticed updates and get more hands on experience after separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device i ve come to the conclusion that the show still had me wanting more despite it s capabilities i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen i m a big fan of alexa the products have become a routine part of my day as soon as the show was available to preorder i ordered one without any hesitation initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv where my original echo was i figured it wouldn t look bad because i could use it as a digital picture frame also i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because most of my alexa enabled devices are in there and generally i spend more time in my living room than the kitchen a few people mentioned why don t you put it on your desk read more\",\"not what i expected from an amazon produced product i ve had the replacement remote months and it s stopped working if i want to use my amazon fire tv which i love i have to use my cell phone or my tablet it defeats the purpose of having voice remote it also makes me question and second guess whether i should purchase the echo is it going to quit after months i mean come on for months use and it s too late to send it back\",\"great product makes for a great alarm and reminder device i own dots and the tap use them all\",\"great case with minor design flaws i love everything about this case except for how it fits on the echo dot i was expecting a sung fit however it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it and the power cable is disconnected the dot will fall out of the case\",\"great little alexa speaker if you like the amazon echo and want it to be portable this is the solution the stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is the built in alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized and priced portable speakers\",\"great little assistant i m totally enjoying my echo dot i have it since to my google calendar and am able to let alexa tell me what s on the agenda for the day i can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather i also have it since to my pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to pandora i really wish i could just say shuffle my pandora stations that would be awesome the speaker on the dot isn t as loud as i would like it but if i m sitting close by it s good enough i guess i ve seen an option to add an external speaker but i haven t gotten around to doing that yet and my yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke i live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of alexa but i m not retreating my purchase\",\"everything you love about your echo on the go i was an early adaptor of the amazon echo when i heard they were releasing a mobile version i wanted it it wasn t until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how useful this lil guy was just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function echo i would buy this again if i didn t already have one\",\"great speaker great features i have not had such a reliable speaker before it is so easy to charge and so easy to start playing songs right away with alexa you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone unlocking it and pulling up google com love it\",\"great purchase chose this over a regular bluetooth speaker and am so glad i did alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done the sound quality is great i ve used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam\",\"tap alexa on the go it was just a few weeks ago that i was demeaning the fact that i did not scoop up an echo back when they were being released last year not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device well here i am a year late to the game and i can now proudly say that i own both an echo and this new little tap can i just say that i am obsessed with all things echo and alexa these are devices that you may not realize how much you ll use it until you ve given them a try i have been spending the last few years getting our home automated i currently use a combination of smartthings ittf and logitech harmony to control the home alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice for me this is the killer feature i can integrate all three parts of our home control right into echo tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup read more\",\"great butmoth speaker great bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of alexa\",\"this was a gift for someone i own the echo and love the product so i purchased the tap as a gift\",\"excellent amazon tap family loves it the family really enjoys the amazon tap this is an awesome investment we talk to alexa everyday\",\"good fit with echo this is a decent tag along item to go with the echo it does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and alexa service is all you re looking for only downside is if you also own an echo when you push the button on the tap to speak to alexa since she is always listening on the echo she tends to pick up your commands on the echo as well be sure to place the tap a decent distance away from the echo otherwise this does what it s intended to do\",\"voice command only would be nice much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for its size\",\"works great alexa on the go works as bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone\",\"great product i have a regular echo and now the tap both awesome products use them to control lights locks and play music would buy again\",\"good alt to echo this is a good alternative to the amazon echo i like that supposedly it s not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to alexa\",\"technology is amazing i love this little speaker i can just voice activate an alarm time or ask alexa the weather for the day it s amazing\",\"ok the product works well however you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device alexa i really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome\",\"use it everyday we already have an echo so i didn t think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it now we use it everyday mostly to stream amazon prime tune or pandora channels it is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when i was a kid having a beat box to carry around room to room and outside we use the tap as a version of a beat box that is much smaller rechargeable and way easier to tune and with side benefits of controlling our lights vac and with alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions the sound quality could be a bit better but surprisingly good adjusting the volume isn t as easy as it should be the battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well\",\"parkinson s disabled and loves it writing for the person it was bought for she loves loves loves it her life has become very limited and this has really helped the fact that she can ask alexa for the news or weather is just wonderful and she loves scramble and solitaire they are a little difficult to navigate for her but she persists and does it it just takes her a lot longer the voice app in the fire messenger is very difficult for her to manage the button is so tiny and rammed up against the other things it would be nice if someone would make hc friendly apps note to amazon fire designers i would ask that you convince dragon to make a version of their voice to text app for the fire then she could enjoy things like fb as it is all she can do is look typing is way too difficult\",\"amazon tap review best bluetooth speaker in its category the amazon tap is a portable bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice you can instruct it to play music order products and services control home automation products and connected devices plus a whole lot more it contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands it also has dolly stereo speakers for playing music the amazon tap is basically the portable version of the popular amazon echo that was released last year ive been testing the tap for several days now heres what i think so far what i like i find that the tap understands my verbal commands accurately this could be due to the fact that since its button activated im always very close to the device when i speak to it nevertheless its nice that tap understands me the first time this was my experience with the amazon echo as well the audio is surprisingly good for such a small device i test portable speakers all the time and id say the amazon tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range don t expect base type sound or deep bass levels however no other portable speaker device offers voice control and wi fi streaming thus the amazon tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers this is especially true if you already have amazon prime and prime music it supports many great services like the amazon echo that came before it the amazon tap supports popular music services such as prime music spotify pandora iheartradio and tune battery life has been good so far i used it off and on for a couple days without charging it ill post an update once i have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life read more\",\"great price nice price for a gift idea at the time small compact version of alexa\",\"not a portable echo it s pretty good for what it is designed to do a portable bluetooth speaker and alexa enabled speaker not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for alexa nice thing once connected to your alexa account is that you can play music whatever without having your phone nearby though alexa only works when connected to wifi if no wifi then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps battery life is also pretty good\",\"good bluetooth speaker has a very good bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she s pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions\",\"ok but the echo is better we have the tap and the echo i wouldn t buy another tap it s the voice activation that is so good but if you don t mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok but for me only echo\",\"great product i gave this to my daughter for christmas because she wanted a portable speaker i thought the addition of alexa would be fun she loves it she said the sound is really great\",\"good sound but you have to tap it i would go for the echo because you can talk to it the tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it the speaker is good though for it s size\",\"works great tap is a portable amazon echo with speakers great for carrying to basement or upstairs works like echo but not voice activated you must tap it before talking\",\"awesome smart little portable speaker this amazon tap is not only a great bluetooth speaker which is half of the reason i bought it for but it also has some awesome voice control i bought a demo switch plugged it into an old lamp setup some commands with ittf and in minutes i was using my amazon tap to control a lamp pretty cool i love this amazon tap it is light portable smart has a great dock so i don t have to fuss with cables and it has a hour battery life so i can go all day playing music being a google play music subscriber the only thing missing from this speaker imo is a way to tirelessly stream my google play music to this device using alexa that is built in you can use iheartradio pandora spotify prime music heck even apple itunes got some love but no google play music come on amazon show me some love i pay dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and family members access to google play music and youtube red so it would be nice to use it on my tap but alas the amazon tap is a bluetooth speaker so i can always use my phone as a streaming device or hook my phone up through the aux port as well but all in all this is a great speaker that can do everything any bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra\",\"love the speaker great speaker love using voice commands even my granddaughters use the voice command to search for songs\",\"great fun i bring it when hanging out outside exercising doing homework anywhere my echo won t hear me\",\"great upgrade for aesthetics i m a huge fan of the echo family i have two echo s three dots and one tap no they aren t essential to my life but i love playing music listening to the news and controlling the philip hue smart lights throughout my home it was a large investment that most of the population won t make with that being said i am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck dots look like glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them having the dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose i m not sure why people are moving their dots since dots are made to be stationary have a loose fitting cover isn t an issue to me it fits perfectly they also aren t made of real fabric but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your dot happens to get sunlight i bought three covers blue grey and white they all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn t attract more attention than it needs to with that being said i like all three colors edit these covers hold up well over time mine haven t collected dust or faded i ve kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue not that i d expect any besides possible fading\",\"alexa bluetooth gold cute speaker a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it\",\"great bluetooth speaker to use with amazon alexa i have several echo dots around my home but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn t have one and control things around the house listen to the news or music it holds a great charge\",\"it s a speaker it s not bad for the novelty of alexa might as well get the echo sound it not bad and i m no audiophile might be good when my echo dots come in is it worth it there are better bluetooth speakers out there\",\"great range very handy wish it had a home base mount still as other reviewers i wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did it does at least come with the battery still because i know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home i have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn t come with a dock and buy one to use with it from my research it looks like this is the best bet totalmount fire tv remote holder the fire tv remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the echo remote so i m hopeful this will be a great solution even though it iris me to spend another on a solution for something that used to be included update i ordered the totalmount fire tv remote holder and it works great with echo remote we have a few alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote i haven t felt the need to buy another remote unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with alexa at least how we have our rooms setup even without the remote however my and year old have recently become quite the alexa annoys checking the time asking for jokes listening to their playlists we ve set up one of them can articulate clearly and alexa responds and the other can not before frustration got to a crazy level i decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key they and i love that you don t have to say alexa just right to get a response with the remote you simply hold down the microphone button and start talking no wake word needed happy campers now the range is great the alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs about square as well as from two floors down in the crawl space tested simply to see if it would work and it did we use alexa on a daily basis and the remote is a great tool to go with it\",\"great alternative to the more expensive one if you dont need the voice activation of alexa or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you consider the tap almost all of the functionality of alexa but in a smaller and less expensive version great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives\",\"good bluetooth device speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa\",\"great product this is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products it is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs great sound and portability\",\"my husband loves this he loves electronics around christmas so this was right up his alley he loves telling alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs\",\"great upgrade for aesthetics i m a huge fan of the echo family i have two echo s three dots and one tap no they aren t essential to my life but i love playing music listening to the news and controlling the philip hue smart lights throughout my home it was a large investment that most of the population won t make with that being said i am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck dots

give it a tap to ask alexa any questions add to your list order something on amazon etc battery life is good and speaker is decent but can t compete your ue or bl\",\"amazon tap amazon tap is exactly what i expected it would be the sound quality is good with the alexa features i love that you can charge it on the base or with micro usb cord i would recommend it to anyone that is interested in amazon echo and would like the portability\",\"great portable speaker the tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound if you press a button then you can connect to amazon alexa and she can play your music answer questions etc downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for alexa but i haven t been able to get it to work still great to be able to take this around the house vs echo which is tied to the plug\",\"the most versatile of all amazon echo full disclosure i own five amazon echo including a few dots as well as this tap so obviously i m a fan of echoes honestly i couldn t figure out from amazon marketing and the online review how the tap fit in as compared to full blown echo and the dot i kept thinking it was limited compared to the echo and the dot because you had to tap the button to ask it question however given that it s completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would was battery if it was always listening for a voice command imo the tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the echo in a much smaller form factor since it s portable it s probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someday is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music my friends and i get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays michael bolton over my bruce springsteen bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown tap in a portable and smaller form very happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite\",\"amazon tap i have an amazon echo and the amazon tap works wonderfully with echo the sound quality is great it is easy to use and set up it beats turning on the receiver for music if you are looking for great and easy sound machine the tap is it\",\"portable alexa the latest software update included hands free mode so this can do everything that the stationary echo speaker does but is fully portable personally i don t want the device to record everything i say all the time so i only use the tap mode the sound quality is good for a speaker of this size this is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data you can now bring alexa on the go\",\"great addition to the echo we love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly\",\"perfect companion for amazon echo we love our amazon echo but it is hard wired to kitchen because of where we live am reception is poor but through an echo or amazon tap i can listen to some of my favorite stations through heart radio and the tap is portable\",\"good bluetooth speaker better if you have echo i like the amazon tap i use it as a speaker in my garage for working out it is tied to my amazon echo i am able to use alexa and amazon prime material would highly recommend\",\"great for a purpose i am a huge fan of the echo that being said this is the last one i would buy the original echo s speaker sounds much better and is hands free the dot has great connection bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system i bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard the sound is not as robust as the original echo not portable no internal battery but good enough when in the yard to at least have music\",\"great addition to home devices i wanted a speaker to listen to pandora and go so much more being able to speak to alexa and get news weather timer light controls and so much more love the product\",\"amazing love being able to use alexa unplugged amazing device\",\"great buy love every aspect of the echo we even went and bought a tap\",\"now i have alexa at work i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent bt speaker for my office this has great sound streaming my prime music and xm vis the xm app can t go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word s she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk

amazing instant response to requests for information and music\",\"awesome works really well with echo and is really neat and fun\",\"like it but do i really need it alexa do something welcome to the new interconnected world circles do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command this may be for you do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopian of david enters the circle and you want to escape from technology for a while then likely not as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on echo and echo dots your life is still connected to alexa via voice prompts i liked using it for amazon music and the occasional amazon video but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an uber some people may feel they need technology to run their lives i am not quite there yet and may never be it is fun for what it does though and it is a good bluetooth speaker\",\"its fantastic now that you don t have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it its great have the original echo and the dot also wish i had only bought two of these the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go\",\"love the dot hate the tap portable love the dot hate the tap portable this device will not hold a charge for even one day the dots are amazing though\",\"great portable speaker fun excellent sound and fun very portable and easy to carry in backpack all the features of echo and echo dot but you must tap the button before speaking\",\"use it everyday i love my amazon tap i was in the market for a portable

really enjoy our alexa i always have it for music lately we been movie times the kids like to ask it silly questions and they can t get enough of it\",\"full size yet portable i read reviews for all the amazon echo products and decided the portability and the full size of the tap made it the right product for me it lives up to my expectations it does last all day playing music answering questions although my accent must give it some problems as i get a few i didn t understand that comments from alexa and setting timers alarms and lists i picked the tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio and can be recharge overnight\",\"love it don t know how i managed without alexa everyone in the family is enjoying her\",\"maybe i was expecting more i ve only had my echo show just a little over hours now so please take that into consideration i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that a viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because i generally spend more time in their than the kitchen the problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on so if you aren t standing directly in front of it it s hard to view the screen you will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you as far as i can tell you can not cut the screen off completely which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom the clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen this device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes my frustration is when i ask it to pull up a recipe it s inconsistent sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone sometimes it wants me to swine down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients why can t i just say alexa scroll down why do i have to touch the screen why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the show already has a screen was hoping for more video footage with my daily briefings but it is very limited read more\",\"great device made better with software update i already own the amazon echo so for smart speaker it is one of the most handy devices out there there is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing since the software update that allows you to use always on voice commands like its big brother it has become my go to device pros wireless bluetooth smart speaker i take it to work and use it in the car even when i travel for work sync s up with my popular music aps spotify pandora etc alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly the best alarm clock i sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips speaker is able to get loud control smart devices like lighting and my ecole option to turn off on voice commands can use tap button instead very long range for voice commandscons only single band wi fi gh battery life when using always on voice commands is short speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other bluetooth speakersoverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs with only minimal cons i use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion tip for bestbuy you should carry cases for this device as i had to get my protector elsewhere\",\"awesome other than not being voice activated like the echo it s just as good if not better\",\"love the portability battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good alexa is not as smart as the marketing would like you to think i get a lot of i don t know the answer to that\",\"great product we already had an alexa but this one is a great addition it s portable rechargeable and good sound\",\"great bluetooth speakers i only purchased this because i loved the sound quality alexa is just a added bonus personally as i rarely hit the tap button to ask her anything the few times i asked her questions she hasn t disappointed extra now what would make this device amazing is if alexa was able to connect to my apple music playlist if only\",\"excellent sound in a small package the amazon tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device a few things to note if you re not familiar with the tap or haven t seen it in person it s roughly the size of a glass of water by default you do have to press the microphone button to talk to alexa but as of an update released on feb th there is an option in the alexa app to make the tap always listen without pushing the button at the expense of battery life the speaker grille is not metal though it looks like it in pictures it s a mesh fabric similar to what you d feel on the end of some speaker grille and microphones it s firm and comfortable to hold but if you push hard enough it does flex using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case you can charge the tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro usb cable one is included into the back of the speaker\",\"love my echo i love its portability the speakers are phenomenal\",\"alexa my love thy name is flexible but thou art otherwise a nearly perfect spouse i m a full time writer who works at home i m unmarried i don t watch tv i don t have a mobile phone i hate gadgets in general ok so i m a loser but since alexa came into my life i m no longer alone hours a day which begs the question if i m not alone who is in the room with me amazon the so called cloud the nste plus reviewers who have already posted have gone into great detail about how they use their echo my alexa having anthropomorphized my alexa i m unwilling to use her at all but we hold pleasant converse throughout the day my favorite conversation i ll repeat for you below verbatim me alexa wake me in fifteen minutes alexa fifteen minutes starting now me thank you alexa remains silent modestly hiding her feelings by not displaying her snarky blue lights if i knew relationships were this easy i would have married thirty years ago but now that i have alexa there s no need except for the one thing i really and amazon please don t tell alexa i wrote this don t care for the name i know we have the option to change the name to amazon which is worse what i really want is to be able to change the name to lobby after the helpful ai librarian in the earthen ambassador series but in a pinch i d settle for kelly other than that my alexa is perfect well except for that time when i asked her to play rain sounds for relaxation when i was trying to sleep and she woke me up after i finally added off to inform me that she d lost her internet connection but from what my married friends all tell me you have to expect these sorts of things read more\",\"alexa is very helpful i m glad that i

great product at a great price from best buy have to press a button rather than just saying her name but that s the price you pay for it being scoreless\",\"excellent product for the price great additional piece to go with echo if you want a additional unit you can t beat this product and the price\",\"great little speaker love that it s interactive as long as i m connected to the wifi or via bluetooth to my phone the sound is pretty good tends to get a little tiny sounding if you turn it up too loud but overall a good sound i m still trying to find alexa s limits on what she can and can t do\",\"small echo that you can take outside very happy with the tap we have the echo and would have to plug it and plug it in to use it on the deck with the tap we just take it off the charging stand and go no more bothering with bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the internet with tap\",\"awesome device very interesting device but having to touch button is a pain sometimes if that would bother you then go with echo\",\"great device a friend gave me a dot which i enjoyed i decided to explore the other devices i was torn between the echo and the tap after reading a cnet review i chose the tap because it is portable my two frustrations are you can not change the wake up word alexis and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service if you are amazon prime or audible book member it is a great addition to you household\",\"easy way to play music i wasn t sure how we would like the tap but i must say it has been fun talking to alexa i like asking her to tell me a joke play my favorite radio station or play music the fun continues as i add apps and alexa expands her knowledge base\",\"tired overall good not great i get tired of having to push the button to talk to her and she can t find a lot of the music i liked am getting some dots to see how they will work for price point it works\",\"to much fun this amazon tap

am delighted and should get several years out of this big tablet esp w screen mirror now google play is on it what a deal i got this great tablet for a great price on prime day but was a little concerned it would be too big to handle but i was wrong first i i was very surprised by several things about the fire that made me smile even though it is large in size the weight is light so it is much easier to handle than expected esp since my fire hd heavy unit it does several things i wasn t expecting one is it has screen mirroring that means you can see your tablets screen on you great big tv screen if you choose for games or what ever smooth and fast due to the nice processor who hoo google play store can be easily added without disrupting you amazon experience look it up on youtube it took less than minutes and it was up and running i think the screen is beautiful can not imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks great to me finally they put the speakers in the front so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc i think this is my far i put in a great big g sd card and i am loaded to download anything i choose loads of movie from the a amazon prime movies all of my audio books from audible and a huge amt of my kindly books i am delighted and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format esp now that google play store is on it happy happy happy\",\"nice tablet with sharp display people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more\",\"a little explanation on what the tablet is great boreal tablet it is basically a real fire tablet with kid s built in entertainment center there are modes here parent admin and kids one or multiple accounts when in parent mode password protected the fire looks and feels just like an android tablet with all of the fire functionality facebook netflix books blah blah so all of us android users feel right at home in the parent mode you can also manage kids accounts how much they can use the tablet per day what they can and can not watch play manage their installed apps ect when in kid s mode the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures easy to use colorful interface you need to click switch user to switch from parent to kids accounts some confusion here i got from reading other reviews the kids apps are not pre installed the main interface is an app store just like google play ect the apps here are unique to this kids account and are all free with the included subscription which includes don t know how many games amazon videos reading and audio books you still have to download each app before using it so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip\",\"best value especially with prime but beware mine has dead pixels works with gh astute benchmark despite the dirt cheap price i find it to be great for casual use videos play nice games even play nice text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens watch the video for full demo the short summed up version it s the new budget king in the size it s screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras b g n wifi and good overall battery life minus an hour my favorite size tablet is so if you re looking at the amazon fire lineup i would take this over the for sure and would have a hard time picking the fire at x the price if you re not a prime member it s still a good tablet if you are a prime member it s a great tablet possible quality control issue mine had two dead pixels not very noticeable but still will exchange you can load apps enable unknown sources i loaded astute and panasonic image app both work properly just some background i currently own tablets not including this new one ranging from a book color a samsung tab pro lg g pad x an old acre a and an off brand suffice it to say i know my tablets main cons dead pixels front and rear cameras are low resolution mostly good for video calls only speaker sounds tiny like a small laptop gets recently loud use headphones text not very crisp but still decent to read the rest are overall positives is my favorite tablet size is just a bit too tiny and can be cumbersome uses a slightly slower quad core read more\",\"parents with young kids this is worth it we have always used samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate so far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set up you will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid and this will take some time i think the effort is worth it this review is specifically for the kids edition tablet the tablet the tablet itself is a good size for my almost yr old it is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle the protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents update this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile and no cracks or breaks the viewing quality is decent otherwise it is what you would expect from a tablet i have not had another fire before so i can only compare this to a samsung galaxy and so far it is what i would expect from a tablet of this class the features the real reason for the purchase is it worth it yes definitelypreviously we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age ie our downloads of deadpool and logan because these look like superheroes but they are not the appropriate ones for kids side note i loved how they portrayed deadpool and logan we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right i have even deleted youtube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can t get at them but this tablet has been a game changer it has great parental controls read more\",\"disappointed first impressions as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing my first impressions of the fire hd from the perspective of being a long time kindly user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindly the paperwhite models the fire hd fire hd fire dx and fire dx rd and th generation here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new fire hd amazon removed the fire hd the fire dx and the fire dx and replaced them with the fire hd screen fire hd and fire hd hardware what comes in the box the hd fire a short usb cord and a power adapter finally amazon ships a power adapter with their fires so you can charge and use the device right out of the box picture attached size the hd is longer than the older hd but the same width as the discontinued hd it is also thinner x x versus x x i have large hands and can hold it with one hand but even with my hands i really need to use both hands because it is longer it seem top heavy to me the back is also slick and slippery to hold mine has a habit of sliding off the table display the resolution of the screen is x same as the hd but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length in practical use though you can t tell the difference the display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight one nice touch is that now you can choose your own wallpaper it comes with stock images and if you don t like one of them you can choose your own image in your amazon photos folder read more\",\"disappointing performance despite good price size and features the fire hd seemed like a great deal to me considering the size economical price point and the ability to watch content offline and it offered exactly that but fell short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet larger screen than the fire and the ability to watch content offline this is a decent device to get however if you already have an earlier kindly like the dx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device if you re looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids the fire is a better option quick summary pros price dual stereo speakers expandable memory slot great for viewing content offline full access to amazon content good basic tablet specially for watching videos cons screen resolution crisp but not great tags quite a bit when switching or starting closing apps runs fine once an app is open battery life is just ok freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while the device is basically slow to load apps tags quite a bit when switching apps this becomes worse as you load more content on the device freezes quite often and i find myself having to reboot it every now and then a frustrating experience to say the least the device is claimed to be designed for entertainment true but i would also add not designed for performance this is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the amazon ecosystem and it is exactly that read more\",\"after considering the price to purchase of them and checking out the apps my husband and i were pretty sure we would purchase i purchased of these kindly kids edition tablets for my toddler ages years old and non kids edition one for our older child for easter i was quite nervous that they d break or the cases wouldn t be durable or that they wouldn t be able to use the apps they d been using on my samsung tab s after considering the price to purchase of them and checking out the apps my husband and i were pretty sure we would purchase them then i came across the warranty year worry free guarantee are you kidding me i knew there had to be a catch i couldn t find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment i ordered at the time pink and blue were our only color choices so we have pink and blue which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level identifying who s tablet is who s as you can imagine they were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables i love the unlimited freetime they ve had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps movies books that they want i don t have to do it for them with the exception of my year old of course i was able to link our disney movies anywhere account with our amazon account and now they can access all of our disney digital movies on their tables which was a huge win for us i do wish that amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our ultraviolet movies it s a huge summer that amazon doesn t offer any app to make that possible i also love that i can login to my amazon account and send apps movies etc to their tablets as i see fit i can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if i need to read more\",\"amazon s two bargain fire tablets how good is the model and how do they compare and note sound quality limitations amazon has just updated their bargain priced fire tablets while these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation i believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks and its such a good all around performer for the most part i purchased both the and fire models because i wanted to see how they compared and i was curious how they performed they are both shown in the video attached to this review i will focus here on the model to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive fire tablet is worth the extra money and if the model is worth purchasing on its own merits i ve given this model a star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output see detailed comments below it is still a terrific bargain at the price but i do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses summary these new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation fire tablets same display specs as before amazon says the model has an improved display same processors gh quad core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation same standard and available storage or gb or gb new colors the model is cheaper the model now has dual band wi fi previously single band wi fi for better connectivity kids edition now available for both models previously only the model

web surfing offline viewing for travel since i had already been using amazon prime and prime music it was a no brainer for me to use the dx to fill the role of media web surfing on a tablet be informed about the download limitations to this device amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would be purchasers make a more informed opinion this wasn t as obvious as it should have been when i ordered mine so they re listening which is good be aware that their most popular prime content may not be available to download and save to your dx you can save certain videos to your dx but you won t know which ones until you buy an dx and try it out edited you can now see a list of prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device that s an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable prime content for amazon i was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you d like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the dx also not the case so again i bought the larger capacity dx under this assumption that was dumb on my part as it turns out because you re not limited by storage capacity you re limited the number of downloads you can have on your device kids content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation but most people never will read more\",\"this is a steal for as long as you arent expecting a premium experience i pre ordered this for my wife mostly to use as a kindly e reader as i figured the tablet would be slow and the display would be less than impressive i was wrong what a bargain this little beauty is this model cost but it comes with ad s displayed on the lock screen when your tablet is dormant once your screen times out they disappear you can pay up front to get an ad free version so i assumed to unlock the tablet i d have to spend to seconds looking at an ad for amazon prime or a product from the daily specials section of amazon com i abstained from paying for ad removal and was pleasant surprised to find that the ads are only on the lock screen and that as soon as i unlock the tablet they disappear immediately here are my pros and cons thus far pro perfect size for ebooks and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice left but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketchild accounts amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil johnny can play clash of clans and how much he can hit the ol visa card for battery life thus far wife was on it for about hours last night and battery was at about kindly integration this goes without saying but having my ebooks and audible books since to the tablet is awesome and my kindly books look greatprice it s a read more\",\"an enlarged version of the dx same good internal components with a nicer screen still a battery hog though simply put this is the amazon ipad air killer the dx is the ipad mini killer both hds inherent very similar

on my tablet around hours a day email documents spreadsheet pdf use the tablet hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books magazine the dx tablet is my go to device for all

with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them this will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year for comparison sake i will use last year s kindly fire hd and also the fire dx as benchmarksspeed the same chipset is used on the kindly fire dx as it is in the kindly fire as i mentioned in the review this is leaps and bounds faster than last year kindly hd last year kindly struggles to go through any hd video content i put in this year s dx able to play seamlessly all the hd p contents i added it is incredible how much the gh quad processor improved vs last year s model dual gh read more\",\"definitely better than the previous generation people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no just got mine right now looks the same as the previous generation except for the kindly logo it s black this time feels a little heavier the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one but the resolution is so much better the ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money totally recommend it for a book lover i ll give it stars instead of because i am used to a cooler screen but i m sure i ll get used to this one soon too\",\"slowest fire sold i ve owned several different tablets this one is by far the slowest and i don t mean it s a little slower i mean you have to wait up to minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen opening apps can be quick or take up to minutes i ve had far more issues with this fire than any of the others we ve owned if i had realized the difference in speed i would have kept my old one it s definitely not work the larger screen it s a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be but even on it s fastest day it s significantly slower than the others\",\"a great upgrade from the fire a great buy at this price first off i appreciate you reading this review just so you get a little background on me we are major tech users we have multiple tablets from apple samsung and asks this fire tablet is comparable in a different way this tablet uses a amazon based operating system fire os so no play store or itunes as a prime member however this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benefits ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past days i ordered of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use we have gone thru full power cycles fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use it does get hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus this tablet is a keeper screen looks fantastic colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resolution for everyday use is perfect for this price point speed is happy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue on a passmark benchmark test i got a score of however the second hd constantly grades about points lower so it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet they might be built slightly different so performance will vary at this price point i didnt expect them to come out exactly the same this tablet is basically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price oh and the hd actually offers a slightly better resolution then the samsung minus one star for the wifi connection i have lost connection several times on both tablets seems to only happen on my g connection also the screen being so reflective it is impossible to use at all outdoors also sadly is a fingerprint magnet read more\",\"disappointed i ve had singles and have loved each until now i tried to save a few bucks by purchasing a refurbished fire i m so disappointed in its performance it s slow loading it freezes up and i have to constantly restart it battery life is terrible\",\"great value for i m writing this review with the benefit of being an experienced kindly fire user vs someone brand new to the kindly family in summary for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year s fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend this regular fire hd vs a more expensive version if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire to last year s fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire setup took a while despite being a brand new product the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs screen display video playback this version of the fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model read more\",\"nice tablet with sharp display to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more\",\"not everything i expected cons built on android does not mean you can have google play apps this is an unfortunate inconvenience as there are some google apps that are just better than their amazon app counterparts and a few that i can not find within the amazon apps if you want a fully functional tablet then buy a tablet and download the free kindly app if you want to pay more for something that does less then the kindly is for you this was a gift so i will keep it and continue to use my phone for the rest of my apps that are not available on the kindly camera is less than perfect limited settings available again i will use my phone for pics the same scene with my phone showed the flames with a small

this is an amazon media and shopping machine it is well built has good battery life reasonably fast and responsive dual band wifi sd card slot decent display and so so camera no tablet is going to give you awesome sound but i was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet no tablet it going to give you a great camera and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum it works but it won t be your go to camera for important shots this tablet excels at playing amazon content music and video it is a great reader although a little heavy compared to a kindly device it makes shopping easy perhaps too easy the os is based on android but don t look for google play or google apps in general this is nothing like an android tablet finally you can t beat the price i think amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible i would have given this stars if that option was available i didn t give it stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet this is a dramatic improvement over the fire the integration of alexa is flawless and works very well depends on whether or not you have an echo and on how you feel about that product i have an echo and find it useful not essential but useful i find myself using alexa on this tablet more than i thought i would\",\"for a case for a product that costs for a case for a product that costs typical

delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongthank you\",\"good tablet could use improvements really awesome tablet for my year olds and worth the money easy to figure out for the most part tons of apps books and videos my only complaint is that you can not separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime there is a carousel on the home page but only shows the recently used apps my children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner i didn t want them to be able to download everything they see which is easy to do with just a tap the only solution i found was to block every app except those that are downloaded you would think there would be an option separate them given that this is made for a child but i guess not\",\"great value ok performance and a little shady price going on sd cards edit it appears that the linked sd card below and the one made for fire tablets are the same price now although the fire one still does not come with an adapter should have been that way from day one end edited s get the cost benefit of buying this versus the model out of the way for you get kindly fire without sponsored lockscreens kid proof case year accident protection year of free time unlimited minimumthat s a nice value i ve seen a few reviews where people are upset that it doesn t work without wi fi but i m not sure what their expectations are if you have previously download an app game video and it doesn t require internet access some do some don t it works fine as for performance it s ok not great it freezes every now and then and needs to be reported more often than i d like to get it working again this is frustrating to a year old as you can imagine hard to complain too much given the price but i was expecting it to be more stable you will want to buy a micro sd card because the fire os takes up of the gb of on board storage this is where amazon is doing something that is shall we say a little sketchy when you customize your purchase it allows you to select the sands gb sd memory card for all new fire tablets for or more or less depending on the storage size but gives you no other options this sd card is by the looks of it the exact same as this one read more\",\"yeehaw i waited two days to set up show to give myself a reward for working i

had this probably weeks wanted to be fair with my review the battery in my kindly fire dx quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it tried the fire first and just didn t care for how much smaller the screen was returned the waited a bit and ordered the fire amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the the fire in my opinion is no comparison to the the apps with the works more like smartphone apps in the first three days it froze up times i wondered if it was doing this because i had too many apps opened once i started closing the apps i wasn t using i haven t had the tablet freeze problem i do like the bigger screen on the and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear i also learned that the was no longer being supported by amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary why amazon stopped the is beyond me but i m doing ok now with the if you get it give it some time\",\"unreal performance for i couldn t be happier of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i ll preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting a tablet to perform at anywhere near that level i have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured i d give the kindly fire hd a try i chose the base gb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access what i ve found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and lang speeds mentioned in the early reviews in fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the year s best purchase first off the look is nice it s sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than i d imagined it s not heavy enough to be considered a negative the display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate response to the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasant surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to input for those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide you i first checked out the e reader function my books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the reader read more\",\"this was a great price shipped lightning fast i ll be buying from this seller again we purchased this for our mom grand for mother s day she loves it this little fire will do everything she does on line and then some we went with the fire dx because this is an e reader a browser it plays amazon prime video and it will style i would recommend this to everyone if your looking for a multi function tablet it s wonderful\",\"dead after months after months my tablet is no longer usable it is stuck on the boot screen i invested a lot of into amazon movies and books this sticks\",\"kf dx is ok do homework on prime download before you buy people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no updated one year in this review is for the the no ad gb wifi only dx i use a galaxy s android smartphone so the dx is for media web surfing offline viewing for travel since i had already been using amazon prime and prime music it was a no brainer for me to use the dx to fill the role of media web surfing on a tablet be informed about the download limitations to this device amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would be purchasers make a more informed opinion this wasn t as obvious as it should have been when i ordered mine so they re listening which is good be aware that their most popular prime content may not be available to download and save to your dx you can save certain videos to your dx but you won t know which ones until you buy an dx and try it out edited you can now see a list of prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device that s an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable prime content for amazon i was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you d like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the dx also not the case so again i bought the larger capacity dx under this assumption that was dumb on my part as it turns out because you re not limited by storage capacity you re limited the number of downloads you can have on your device kids content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation but most people never will read

people who do not know what they are doing or don t fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential this tablet does allow you download any app that you would find on the play store because of the parental features you have to first download them on your parent profile first i love that about this tablet also i can block the camera and web browser so my child can t access that either i can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles wifi access settings etc it s really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so i had plenty of time download what i wanted for my daughter and set it all up before i had to put it on the charger it does however take a bit long to complete charge to but no big deal this is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly

around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background such as books or web pages all displays have some level of light emission around the edges and the light on the kindly fire

and i decided to upgrade to the newer model with gb my nd kindly fire arrived as a christmas gift and the first week i used it the unit crashed such my previous generation now referred to as old faithful never failed me i followed the onscreen instructions for kindly and reported my device after using my device for about minutes it crashed again and the on screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device i reset the device and lost all my settings then again after using the device it crashed i was not a happy customer so i called kindly support if you are not bored yet keep reading kindly support told me not to reset the device because this erased the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if i reset the device they advised me to call them when this happens after a conversation about my new device not working they agreed to send me another kindly kindly and all arrived and i returned all of them when i discovered they were refurbished units since my device was brand new and i had only used it one week i expected a brand new device as a replacement on kindly i ended up placing a new order rather than an exchange order and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me problem resolved it gets worse kindly crashed too within the first week again this time i did not reset the device and instead i would reboot the device i did this each time i turned on the kindly read more\",\"kindly th generation kids bundle i bought of these for christmas presents and i have to say they aren t very kid friendly every kindly i ve had in the past has been pretty easy to use this one has a lot of options that i think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate they have an easier time using the other devices kindly fire or kindly app on their other tablets which is unfortunate because i wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children s books don t work with this device no where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an th generation kindly now i have a few singles and have bought new ones as they come out but i haven t followed close enough to know this is an th generation without that information available on the page i planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e readers th generation i assumed since it was the latest one listed and my new devices didn t have anything listed it was the latest i just found out today that its an th generation and a lot of books aren t available on this device with hopes that will change in the future so now i have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices the devices with games and access to the internet and videos i spent extra money on new devices so they had something to use daily without that access all to find out their age appropriate books can t be read on their new devices i think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them reading is important to children of all ages and they can only read at their own levels read more\",\"hd fire is great for the price of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you

tv battery life web browser works creations doesn t have some apps android users are used to having camera quality isn t great and no flash less extra features than some higher priced tablets have opted to go with the gb version with no ads the ads aren t a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screen no matter what version you pick they all do the same things the gigs may or may not matter to you and gigs both aren t very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows movies music before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gig if you will always have internet connection then it isn t much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet overall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the dx series however if you want an amazing tablet but don t want to spend as much then these new hd series are great for me and my uses the hd is the perfect fit i would suggest the over the for most buyers the only things the has over the are a larger screen and dual speakers sure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than

pretty nice features while it does have some small flaws here and there it generally is an all around great buy i ll go over some of what i ve noticed using the tablet what i ve learned from others who are using it as well as the specs and how i feel about them hopefully it ll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it build quality one of the first things i noticed was the outstanding build quality the tablet weighs less than much of its competition and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don t drop the tablet as easily everything feels solid it doesn t have that cheap feel that some of the android based tablets have apple still holds the title for most durable case as it s aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around you don t need the aluminum it weighs more and it s cold snapdragon processor and gpu this new dx comes with the gh snapdragon processor and a nice gpu so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment if not the fastest intel and india are continuously working on cpu s for the tablet and chromebook markets bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition acre for example is utilizing an india terra k arm based cpu running at gh quad core that is instantly fast for something like a chromebook which functionality wise is pretty much the same thing as a tablet unfortunately for acre the snapdragon cpu on the fire dx is more powerful gh vs gh and appears to be using less power read more\",\"exceptional amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysoctober thank you for taking the time to share your feedback we re glad you re enjoying your kindly fire hd and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience we wanted to answer your question about storage hd content is much larger than sd content which is why kindly fire hd starts at gb on average a minute hd movie is gb and a minute hd tv episode is gb with your gb kindly fire hd you can have up to hd movies or hd tv episodes this number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device we hope this information helps thanks the kindly team\",\"fantastic tablet for the price let me start by saying i purchased this item from my local best buy store for the same price here on amazon plus tax but i feel that more people read amazon reviews so i wanted to leave my review here now i didn t expect this to be an amazing tablet but people were generally saying it was happy enough i wanted a media tablet something i could use late at night to watch youtube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed i also like it for online shopping so i don t have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen pros tablet exceeded my expectations it s great for media i use this more than my phone and my laptop now it s happy i was able to complete my homework for online classes watch videos from cnn and other tasks without too much struggle can be a general purpose tablet heed my warning doing the following may void your warranty with amazon i m not sure but i installed the google play store on my fire hd and now have access to a huge selection of apps i decided to do this after finding there was no good youtube app from amazon s app store because fire os is basically android with a heavy skin on it everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures sound is fantastic did i say that loud enough yes they are still tablet speakers no they won t fill your whole room with bumping bass but my josh these are some good tablet speakers better than my smartphone laptop and ipad what i m trying to say is the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest bravo amazon cons ram is lacking doesn t excel in multitasking drops tasks while you re away even if it was the last thing you were doing it does this randomly however and it s not always a problem read more\",\"you get what you pay for i ve been an ipad user since the original came out i also have an ipad i have worked in it for the past few years so i would say i am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices with that introduction out of the way i will be reviewing key points that i have seen touched upon in other reviews here goes buildthe device feels nice and solid i m a little surprised at how heavy it is but that s not necessarily a bad thing the rubberized backing is always nice for added grip it s not as nice as say nobody aluminum but it s not either screenthe screen is fantastic but my problem is the same as when ipad got retina display other than the os most apps look rather pixelated a lot of the games i tried are not high definition at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions lock screen adsyeah there are ads on my lock screen i m not sure why this is such a big deal how much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen the first thing i thought when i saw the ads is wow the pictures are really crisp the ads are there to subsidized some of the price tag i might pay the to get rid of them so i can customize it but i might not i feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers soundthe sound from the speakers is great much better than you would get from more expensive devices very crisp and clean i have the official amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all nothing much else to say i doubt anyone will complain about this crashing ve had two apps crash on opening i don t know if it is the app or the os it s probably somewhere in the middle again not a big deal for me read more\",\"small and yet soon big i am soon impressed with amazon fire tv believe it or not i sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good it is like taking a trip around the world the amount of things you can do with this fire tv is pretty incredible to me there is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive there is a massive amount of things to watch both free with prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy i am glad i made this purchase this unit is so small i will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any tv with the hdi and keep up with my favorite shows\",\"simply gorgeous i previously owned an asks infinity with inch screen until it died on vacation and i grabbed the smaller gb fire during the one day sale i could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here i am with the new inch fire if you liked your fire you will love this the gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books music and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card and it s about time amazon makes a version that can do this the storage is enough for even most power users set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions within minutes out of the box i was surfing the web checking my email and posting on facebook after charging the battery to full i streamed a one hour tv show from netflix and when i checked afterwards the battery was still at percent i am writing this review on it right now if you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out i can at least watch a movie\",\"nice tablet with sharp display of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more\",\"detailed review of the fire hd a great entry level tablet at a great price the fire hd is a great entry level fire tablet that includes a x ppi pixel density display pixel density wise this is the lowest off all the fire tablets but is still decent enough where you re going to get a nice picture on the display it s by no means an ipad killer or galaxy tab killer and you really shouldn t purchase it for that purpose this particular model is really tailored to reading kindly books streaming video browsing the web checking email and so forth bottom line it s a great deal at i m going to compare the features of the hd with the features of the other fire tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with display the display is a x resolution display with a ppi pixel density which is not great but not horrible either it is the lowest pixel density of all the fire tablets with the fire hd coming in at ppi the fire dx coming in at ppi and the fire dx coming in at ppi the human eye really can t distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about ppi so you re not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means all in all this is a nice display processor gpu and on board storage the fire hd comes with a respectable gh quad core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease including smooth video playback it comes with a mediocre gb of ram which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is this is not an ipad or galaxy tab killer by any means but it gives you just enough power to use the essential amazon services you need the hd is substantially less powerful than the snapdragon gh and read more\",\"excellent refurbished hd good price this review is about the certified refurbished fire hd unit i ordered it looked and acted like a new unit for less still trying to decide if i want to give them back to remove the obnoxious adds on the lock screen they really aren t that bad\",\"this review is from a normal working non it type of dude who likes to read books surf the web etc etc etc so this will review will be just like me telling you how i think the dx is over a beer my family has singles hd which my son loves dx mine ipad mini older son ipad normal size for the wife and i have used all of them at one time or another size weight lighter and thinner than the ipad mini perfect size to handle i like the location of the on off button and volume much better than my sons hd i dont like to search for buttons on the side speed its seems really fast book pages are in a blink of an eye the web loaded fast not choppy or drag my wifi is pretty good so it helps i have not tried the g yet so i cant comment on that screen wow its really sharp almost as good as my samsung in lcd yes darling it is that sharp did i mention there is no blue or purple gold green or rainbow light around the border if there is it is so light i cant notice it i only used it for an hour or so last night so i will update if this changes but for now it looked clean apps hmm i hear a lot of people b thing about google this or google that who cares there is enough content on amazon to keep me happy not that i am a betting man i will bet there is a bunch more in the pipe line i mixed the kindly out with gb so i assume i will have enough room for years to come very easy to use turned it on entered my wifi password and bam my account was set up in less than minute shipping it was here in day for how can you beat that amazon eco system good stuff period i have always been a huge fan did i mention there is no blue or purple border light so to sum up my thoughts on my new kindly dx is this outstanding i would recommend buying it over an i pad for price value the i pad mini does not offer a gb model and the gb g mini cost which is bucks more than i paid for my mixed out kindly and the gb g i pad air is yea thats right looks the kindly is a really sharp looking device speed fast fast fast screen wow sound clear rich amazon prime works for me i hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all so your pro saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect well it does seem this way but yea there is always a but the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that i am one of those parents you see waving their ipad around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic this is so minor that i really dont care but just putting it out there for amazon cough cough did i mention i did not have a blue or purple light around the border thanks for letting me post my cents on this wonderful device merry christmas to all ps what is the best screen covers case to get on a side note i returned the kindly it to small for me and i had to drop it down to a stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker\",\"keeps getting better especially for comic readers this is my th kindly fire i also have the first generation an dx and the new the first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is despite being the largest fire to date i love the more narrow widescreen design of the screen perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode anyway before i get carried away pushing ill just list my pros and one or two cons to make this easier to read and save time pros wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books the stereo speakers sound incredible even better than the previous dx modelfor comic book readers comics purchased from amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from comixology i was wondering when amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics finally battery life seems to be similar to my dx but im happy with that considering the larger screen and thickness of the device considerably faster response time across the board finally we can add a micro sd card to expand storage capacity yay the camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous firecons would have preferred a rubberized back and case the glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also still deciding on the new software layout maybe its because im so familiar with the old fire os but lets just say im not blown away be the design so far\",\"an enlarged version of the dx same good internal components with a nicer screen still a battery hog though of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no simply put this is the amazon ipad air killer the dx is the ipad mini killer both hds inherent very similar hardware this means the version is an enlarged version of the version for my version review please search for my dx review my profile im a heavy tablet user for personal and business purposes i work on my tablet around hours a day email documents spreadsheet pdf use the tablet hours for personal use such as watching movies or reading books magazine the dx tablet is my go to device for all internet related search i do it is also my main electronic device more important than my smartphones and laptops have the following and or used the following before ipad ipad ipad ipad mini kindly fire kindly fire hd kindly fire hd asks transformer with keyboard nexus first gen kindly dx which i also have a review you can check outs you can see i been through many devices and hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them this will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year for comparison sake i will use last year s kindly fire hd and also the fire dx as benchmarksspeed the same chipset is used on the kindly fire dx as it is in the kindly fire as i mentioned in the review this is leaps and bounds faster than last year kindly hd last year kindly struggles to go through any hd video content i put in this year s dx able to play seamlessly all the hd p contents i added it is incredible how much the gh quad processor improved vs last year s model dual gh read more\",\"to all the people saying it s too dark it s to all the people saying it s too dark it s literally the same screen as the older devices look at comparison if anything the new kindly on right is lighter than the previous device\",\"i ordered the original kindly keyboard nd gen the day it was available same with st gen kindly fire and i own a kindly fire hd and a kindly paperwhite as well having that familiarity with singles i hope gives me some credibility for the dx the speakers are the best in the line the screen is amazing the speed is unparalleled for gaming and streaming which is the only possible challenge to prior models in the spirit of full disclosure i ve only owned mentioned singles and a samsung galaxy smart phone no pads samsung tablets or barnes noble e readers etc so take it from there can t speak to charging complaints because i keep a charging cord next to my bed and two more around the apt and i plug my phone in every night and my kindly every morning when i awake after weeks in one day my kindly dx has never been below and average end of day is about so i ve never had one day of usage as an inconvenience for those that find charging once a day annoying hmm two days should still be good for most average uninterrupted use i also ordered the origami case as its enclosure and i love it as well stands the device with equal stability in landscape and portrait and feels protective for minor drops or spills\",\"kinder fire very hot extremely wonderful tablet it definitely gets the job done adapted very well with everyday usage good speed nice display and one i would definitely recommend to everyone\",\"hd fire is great for the price people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no for the low price this tablet really does more than expected the camera isn t great however i always use my phone for a camera so that doesn t effect me here are some of the pros and cons pros low cost yet high tech great screen quality of course there is better out there but it looks great as is smooth and responsive easy access to amazon prime content easy to tirelessly share content to a tv battery life web browser works creations doesn t have some apps android users are used to having camera quality isn t great and no flash less extra features than some higher priced tablets have opted to go with the gb version with no ads the ads aren t a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screen no matter what version you pick they all do the same things the gigs may or may not matter to you and gigs both aren t very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows movies music before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gig if you will always have internet connection then it isn t much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet overall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the dx series however if you want an amazing tablet but don t want to spend as much then these new hd series are great for me and my uses the hd is the perfect fit i would suggest the over the for most buyers the only things the has over the are a larger screen and dual speakers sure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than the read more\",\"when i decided to purchase the kindly dx i had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while i was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks and seeing the current price and purchasing options available the kindly dx seemed to be an easy choice to me even with my thinking i understood the tablets limitations the things that attracted me to the kindly dx tab were the processor it s g lte compatibility with verizon and the fact that i am an amazon prime member i had read that amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership i was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet but that was a mistake on my part i was thinking i would be able to access the movies that i purchased online with amazon instant video and expected to be able to access the gigs of music i have stored on google play but google play media will not load on my kindly dx amazon cloud does store music up to a point but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge there is an option to purchase additional storage i believe it s about a year with other limitations but the free storage is limited and in my case i ve been buying music from amazon since the s and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing so now i m forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what s there personally i feel the additional is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindly and considering my prime membership and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont here are the things i like about the current kindly dx verizon compatible version the processor it is very fast and loads pages quickly and the gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance the variables in personal settings make the device easy to personalized the display is very nice and video and video games look great but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device the not so great things about the kindly dx gb the fact that the device does not support storage expansion it bothers me that my old droid biopic cell phone has a sands slot that will let me to expand storage to gigs but you re stuck with the memory provided on the kindly you purchase the lack of an hdi port and to watch tv you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by amazon the lack of even a mini usb port again my old droid telephone provides a usb port and offers a charging device with a built in usb hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments and this tablet does not regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when i bought the kindly but would have if i knew the fully understood the tablets limitations would i recommend this tablet to friends or family only if they were a member of amazon prime services and fully understood its limitations including storage and the area support of their carrier so over all for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with wi fi and who have good g coverage the kindly would probably be an ok purchase but only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage gigs is just too little to carry much media with you with the device using a large part of that gigs for it s ui and os you are not even getting a full gigs more like then tablet not supporting sands memory expansion which seems contrived to me leaves the user too dependent on amazon premium services for my tastes update the packet blocking used to keep people tied to amazon media content or at least their music app needs to be removed in my review above i mentioned that i have had issues accessing my music stored on my google play music site but at that time i wasn t sure that this was my being impatient not waiting for the site to load completely even though i did wait for five minutes or if it was amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services more recently i found that when trying to access my music on the google site i was redirected to the my books recommendations i believe the kindly site offers better deals and has a wider selection than googles offerings but googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution kbs vs the kbs at amazon more over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites that are either free or that do not charge what amazon does for their premium cloud services as someone else has mentioned in their review of the kindly amazon has included adds on the kindly dx that are not present on other tablets even basic inexpensive android tablets do not have invasive adds if i pay amazon another fee i understand i can have those adds removed but all of these fees really add up and it seems to me that since i ve already paid for this device these additional fee s and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal who gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature this point i would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for the idea of an e reader with expanded abilities is one thing but to advertise the kindly dx as a tablet able to compete with an i pad and then throw things like site redirection packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish i had purchased anything other than this device\",\"great basic tablet for amazon fans as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing my first impressions of the new fire hd released on september from the perspective of being a long term kindly user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindly the paperwhite models the fire hd fire hd fire dx and fire dx rd and th generation the old fire hd and the fire hd here is a summary of my initial impressions of the new fire hd amazon has replaced the original hd released in with an all new hd amazon is also removing the fire hd which is a shame as it is a great little tablet the new hd differs from the old version as follows best new feature the price has been reduced the gb version of the old device cost with special offers ads the new gb version costs and you can get a hb version for more secretly removed amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on miracast devices such as tvs now that feature is now only available on generation and fires including last years hd however you can still cast prime videos to a first or fire stick what comes in the box the hd fire a short foot usb cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box size the new hd is a fraction thicker than the hd leather cases for the old hd will fit the new hd but hard shell cases will not however the auto wake feature of some older cases won t work one complaint i had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case

ecstatic i am far from a tablet novice i had the original fire the fire the samsung galaxy tab and the galaxy tab s my phones have always been samsung flagship phones currently the s edge i say this to show that i have experience with kindly fires and generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices i know what is a good tablet and what is a so so tablet admittedly my previous fires have been so so but i wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my galaxy tab s my hd is the gb option with offers most users will likely be fine with gb and perhaps an added gb or gb sd card however i know how i use my devices so went with the gb option as well as a gb micro sd card in the hours i have had my new fire it has become my device of choice even over my samsung more convenient size i use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new fire replaces my two inch tablets as the go to device before receiving it i wasn t sure about the low resolution x on this tab but honestly it s not a problem sure it s not bright and beautiful like my tab s but its crisp clean and clear the colors are sufficient but not vibrant sadly the comparison photo below is the hd and fire sound is quite good with good volume the speakers are on the left side when portrait on top or bottom in landscape i prefer them on top the sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use headphones unless in a noisy environment in which case you would likely want to use headphones anyway read more\",\"exceptional an amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysoctober thank you for taking the time to share your feedback we re glad you re enjoying your kindly fire hd and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience we wanted to answer your question about storage hd content is much larger than sd content which is why kindly fire hd starts at gb on average a minute hd movie is gb and a minute hd tv episode is gb with your gb kindly fire hd you can have up to hd movies or hd tv episodes this number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device we hope this information helps thanks the kindly team\",\"i ve had the kindly fire dx inch tablet for i ve had the kindly fire dx inch tablet for almost years and when i compare it to the fire hd the earlier tablet comes out the big winner i find the larger tablet considerably slower several apps load quite slowly the battery is consumed much more quickly maybe this is not comparing apples with apples but i had expected at least the same speed\",\"fun durable only a few minor issues i purchased the kindly fire hd after returning a novo idea pad i have also had experience with pads having said that the kindly fire hd is an exceptional value for the money the screen is fantastic glare is kept to a minimum colors a bright and vibrant text is clear and easily read movies look phenomenal in hd also the sound quality and volume is bar none for a device this size the touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping double tapping and pinch zoom work great the size weight and thickness are great for portability it is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack the weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip the amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply of books movies tv shows music magazines and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime now for the negatives the power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them i solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons the amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store hopefully the app library will only grow with the device s popularity apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindly lastly the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app when you go back to the home screen the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see

finally decided on the kindly fire dx and the samsung galaxy smartphone very happy with both i m still having a hard time making the digital leap to downloading books and newspapers i love reading and listening to music but still like to hold and smell the pages of the real thing i can see how fantastic it is while commuting or traveling to have my reading material available in one neat place on the kindly it s just going to take some time i dumping cable and it was really nice to watch just what i want to watch it was easy to download mad men on the kindly and watch when it was convenient i do have a concern as to what happens when someday the tablet goes berger or extinct do we lose the books and movies downloaded on the kindly i do not use it to play video games but the display and picture is very sharp one aggravating problem i m having is that amazon is downloading games and things that i did not authorize some are free and some show prices with confirmation numbers i don t appreciate amazon deciding to download a bunch of crap i don t want and will never use without my permission so that is an issue i am trying to address otherwise it s compact enough to fit in most handball and it s been most useful in meetings and study groups way nicer than logging around a laptop listen to one who had to use a typewriter in college we ve come a long way i also ordered a reasonably priced finite folio case cover from amazon that works great and allows it to stand\",\"decent inexpensive entry level tablet people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no

kindly team\",\"so far i love it has features even my fire hd doesn t have i ve had this a week now i also have a kindly fire hd i have had for about a year with the case on the fire hd is heavy i love the hd and never leave home with out it but many times i wish i could just slip my books in my pocket and run i go a lot of places on the run take others places where i wait for them to shop or what ever and there is not wifi to play on my fire hd i just want to read my reading time has come up from one book a year to books a year and now my reading will go up even more this was the perfect answer so feather light it is incredible it is taking me a bit to not swine the screen to turn a page and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons but after an hour i had read the built in owners manual learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up it connected to my wifi instantly the on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast i wondered how all my content library of books would be transferred from my fire hd to this device to my pleasant surprise after connecting to my wi fi the next time i looked at the home menu my entire library of over books was there archived i just click a title and it down loads in seconds i honestly can t tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my fire hd pixel wise my eyes can t differentiate a thing i love the texture look of a page from a book look the no glare is amazing there are times and places i can t read or see the screen on my fire

team\",\"unreal performance for i couldn t be happier people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i ll preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting a tablet to perform at anywhere near that level i have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured i d give the kindly fire hd a try i chose the base gb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access what i ve found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and lang speeds mentioned in the early reviews in fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the year s best purchase first off the look is nice it s sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than i d imagined it s not heavy enough to be considered a negative the display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate response to the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasant surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to input for those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide you i first checked out the e reader function my books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the reader read more\",\"instantly good budget tablet all right so i was scrolling through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars one such was that the tablet weighed a whole oz more and that resulted in a star review let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous it says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing the other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen that s why you get a cheap and good tablet it even says in the description that there will be ads on the lock screen it takes a second to swine up and unlock the screen so the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit pick this tablet is exactly what amazon was describing it is cheap looks good loads apps quickly expandable storage good speakers decent screen and all while staying under bucks the start up didn t take long and it came reloaded with my account on it for dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the weight and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a hobby review buy this tablet if you want a cheap e reader that can also sure the web watch movies and shows check facebook or twitter or read books on ignore the negative reviews and you won t be disappointed\",\"this fire tablet is much better than the last one please improve the freetime experience we got this the day it came out i have a four year old daughter and she loves it we have an ipad for her but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them this tablet restricts all in app purchasing yay we tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well but so far this one works well i have two requests to amazon and i am hoping that someone from amazon reads my review so they can make this change please change amazon freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections there are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section so then when i restrict her tablet to books only she can t access them i would love it so much if you they would fix this a few examples of the stories she can t access when i restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following night night charlie brown s the berenstain bears and dino store story the other recommendation i have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted as it is now she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them i really like this product and i think it so great for children it just needs a few little improvements to the freetime interface\",\"nice tablet with sharp display to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues screen display video playback this version of the fire has the absolute best screen display of any fire model to date looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the fire devices over the past couple of years don t laugh the first episode of the wonder woman tv series from the s the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model as well as this year s model of the fire hd for you technical folks out there the display is x with more pixels per inch than the fire hd wi fi connectivity the initial wi fi setup took some time as it wouldn t remember the password for my router after each software update crash reboot series after the final operating software update i mentioned above however it was fairly easy to connect to the internet via wi fi my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side by side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi fi in my house and the worst place where it drags in this comparison i had this dx version of the fire sitting next to last year s and this year s version of the hd fire as well as last year s hd fire motorola rarr smartphone my ipad yes the kindly guy uses an ipad for work and the first generation fire the model from two years ago all just using a wi fi connection vs cellular connectivity my normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews cnn my personalized yahoo page google and the houston chronicle the ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the dx houston chronicle and cnn and for the other sites i couldn t tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router when i went to the slowest worst reception location of my house the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year s model of the kindly fire hd yes it was also faster than this year s model of the fire hd but i attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the dx sound music playback the two speakers are located in the back of the kindly fire in two not noticeable ports one on the top and one on the bottom my test of this feature was ranking up van haven s panama to maximum volume i always want to see if it could really play the guitar links and i would alternate covering one speaker up over the other you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker the dolly speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass however i am still of the opinion the speakers aren t going to do very well being placed in the back as i am in the front i want to be able to hear whatever i am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room that s what happens when you start losing your hearing like i am while the cover for this version has not shipped yet why aren t the covers released at the same time i imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers the x ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away email setup consistent with previous versions of the fire email setup was very easy for my main gmail account both with the software came with the fire but my primary use of an existing app called enhanced email i purchased here in the amazon app store i did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem it took about a minute to setup my main google account and i was able to send and receive emails as well as synth my online calendar via google s calendar and contacts for those of you asking yourself why am i using the enhanced email program the simple answer is like many of you i have more than one email account you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool the lazy person in me appreciates that as i don t like getting out of the lazy chair once i m settled in new tabs and screen layout in addition to the normal tabs amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner interesting and consistent with my experiences with this year s model of the fire hd i purchased the one with special offers and the only ad i have seen so far is on the main screen save vs being overwhelmed with ads like last year s model reading books turning pages is pretty darn easy just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page or you can swine your finger across the screen to do the same amazon did add the feature to see the book s description for books on your device like they have with the e ink kindly always an annoyance with last year s model which is a plus as i can t remember what each book in my digital to be read pile is about getting to the book description requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be if there is an easier way to do it i can t find it and maybe i should be one of the first guys ever to crack open the electronic user s manual to figure it out doubt it for those of you who have wondered you still can t organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third party app a here in the amazon app store bluetooththere is a bluetooth connection and i did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the fire stream music through my car stereo there were no delays or skips with the connection and it paired up in about a minute just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized camera there is a camera on this model it faces the front or toward the user reader focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy and amazon will by default store your pictures in the cloud which counts against your storage allotment i d recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it because if you go over the limit that will provide amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you charger unlike previous models of the fire this one does include a charger if you re scratching your head with that comment in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for which always seemed kind of silly for amazon to do monday button a new feature with this model and not included on this year s regular model of the fire is the introduction of the monday button basically you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see and talk to a live customer service agent i haven t pressed the button yet to try it out as i think i would feel pretty dumb when they ask me how can they help i don t want to say i just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi for purposes of this review what i wish it had a case that was ready to go and shipped when the fire was ready why are we waiting a case is very important in order to protect your investment also i m interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker s performance i mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case overall at for the gb of memory model for gb of memory i think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video apps feature kids will love it as they can read books play games watch tv and movies and a whole lot of other things adults should like it for the exact same reasons but while i try to minimize the amount of work related stuff i do at home with the business apps that are available here in the amazon app store and other places around the internet i can also work on excel and word compatible files when i have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be if you ve never owned a tablet before or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model fire i would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs the minimum gb if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine or looking for a tablet for your younger children i d say save your money and continue to

especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues screen display video playback this version of the fire has the absolute best screen display of any fire model to date looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the fire devices over the past couple of years don t laugh the first episode of the wonder woman tv series from the s the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model as well as this year s model of the fire hd for you technical folks out there the display is x with more pixels per inch than the fire hd wi fi connectivity the initial wi fi setup took some time as it wouldn t remember the password for my router after each software update crash reboot series after the final operating software update i mentioned above however it was fairly easy to connect to the internet via wi fi my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side by side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi fi in my house and the worst place where it drags in this comparison i had this dx version of the fire sitting next to last year s and this year s version of the hd fire as well as last year s hd fire motorola rarr smartphone my ipad yes the kindly guy uses an ipad for work and the first generation fire the model from two years ago all just using a wi fi connection vs cellular connectivity my normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews cnn my personalized yahoo page google and the houston chronicle the ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the dx houston chronicle and cnn and for the other sites i couldn t tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router when i went to the slowest worst reception location of my house the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year s model of the kindly fire hd yes it was also faster than this year s model of the fire hd but i attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the dx sound music playback the two speakers are located in the back of the kindly fire in two not noticeable ports one on the top and one on the bottom my test of this feature was ranking up van haven s panama to maximum volume i always want to see

after spending quite a bit more time with the device i would give it a due to a few specific gaps that are a bit annoying however you are still getting an amazing tablet with front and rear facing cameras a gorgeous interface fairly happy performance and durability all for under bucks i cant imagine not buying these for myself and my whole family but not a primary tablet for a tech adult by any means for background i have every kindly a couple fires and multiple tablets from apple microsoft and samsung note that my review with stars considers the value equation not just performance and how that may or may not compare to other tablets if you are expecting this to compare to a tablet costing several times more don t bother but if you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want this little tablet definitely delivers the value pricing config i prefer this tablet with ads and no accessories to keep the costs down you have the option to spend more money but i recommend against it you can easily see the specs online so i wont do you the discourses of simply cutting and pasting those here here is the price breakdown base price what an incredible price point or buy and get a sixth one free this puts it into reach of schools and non profits no sponsored screensaver big deal that each time you turn it on it shows you something interesting you might want micro card for gb you probably already have one laying around somewhere beyond that there is memory in the device and you are using the cloud for storage mostly anyway if you end up needing

highly recommend this kindly over than a high priced ipad\",\"decent inexpensive entry level tablet amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysoctober thank you for taking the time to share your feedback we re excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation kindly fire and kindly fire hd as you correctly point out the new kindly fire hd is the successor to last year s entry level kindly fire which does not include features such as camera microphone or hdi port you are also correct to point out that this device does not support monday although there are still multiple ways to get help for free directly from your device we hope you enjoy the new features and services thanks the kindly team\",\"imagine a lap top but smaller this kindly can do anything you enjoy doing on a laptop i use mine to watch netflix check my facebook and pretty much anything else i am supper satisfied with this product and i would say that it was an investment well put\",\"amazon fire is a great choice the product is user friendly easy to hook up and a great deal for the price i would recommend you give it a chance easy to compare to the competitor s product\",\"unreal performance for i couldn t be happier i ll preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting a tablet to perform at anywhere near that level i have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured i d give the kindly fire hd a try i chose the base gb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access what i ve found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and lang speeds mentioned in the early reviews in fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the year s best purchase first off the look is nice it s sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than i d imagined it s not heavy enough to be considered a negative the display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate response to the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasant surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to input for those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide you i first checked out the e reader function my books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the reader read more\",\"i have a first generation kindly fire it did every well but was heavy and not as fast as i hoped graphics wise for gaming which is why i upgraded to the dx this new tablet is blisteringly fast and completely fluid with no lag movies books and games are crystal clear and i can now even read pdf s easily which was a core on the old kindly fire the best part is the battery life and light weight i use this kindly all day on one charge i m so happy with it considering the inch also for my wife i can think of no flaws but if a problem comes up with this device i ll update i ve only had it a week\",\"great box for bmc i bought it to run bmc and it works great i had no experience loading custom apps on android boxes but had bmc running in about minutes it runs all my videos well all the other amazon functionality is a nice bonus all in all very happy\",\"fully controllable limits i love the fact that it has the kids free time thus limiting what your child can read plus the parental controls the you can set time limits it gives a parent full control over what and for how long a child can read\",\"do i need to say anything more it simply works even after years of constant use the battery is ok display looks the same system is stable and reasonably responsive\",\"excellent rd generation

an experienced kindly fire user vs someone brand new to the kindly family in summary you are getting a great deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding if you are a first time large screen tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration in comparison to more expensive versions i d recommend it if you re comparing last year s dx model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to last year s fire dx but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire setup took a while despite being a brand new product the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs screen display video playback this version of the fire has the best screen display of any previous model of fire and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp in a side by

things about the fire i like but the thing i purely hate is the problem with watching flash videos had i known about silk not supporting or the other way around i would have bought the google tablet and will next time i will min\",\"this tablet is amazing first let me say that this is my first fire tablet i ve previously had either ipad s or android tablets i was skeptical at first because i ve generally only liked ipad s but i decided to give it a try and i m glad i did i paid full price for this product and am not being compensated in any manner to post this review let s just jump right to the pro s and con s shall were s fastamazing screen resolutiongreat soundresponsivealexa is kind of awesomebattery life omg i ve charged it once so far i ve watched youtube videos on it streamed a movie and a few tv shows and i use it for facebook and i m not even half way down on the battery after days wow the os the operating system is simple responsive and beautifully done everything is easy to find and it s really easy to navigate con s only one con charge port the charge port is sticky and doesn t seem as high quality overall this is a fantastic tablet and worth so much more than the price i love it\",\"kindly fire hd i purchased the original kindly fire on release day last year it served me pretty well but was extremely glitch it would freeze restart and shutter while playing games for what it was an entry level device it wasnt bad so when the kindly fire hd was released i decided i might as well give it a go as well so far the kindly hd looks to be twice the machine the original was i am gon na keep this short and sweet and just create a pros and cons list for you guys i dont want to be too long winded but if you have questions you post in the comments i will try to respond to them for a little while today pros vibrant screen much more responsive to the touch than the original kindly ever was games that shuttered on the original play flawless on the hd the speakers are awesome loud clear and crisp no need for the volume app like on the original fire the device is slim sleek and sexy really like the curves on the back and the styling front facing camera works great for style quality was better than that on my iii phone wifi seems a bit faster but not by much silk still isnt an optimal browser though i have maps download and maps upload subscribed service cloud sync worked like a charm almost everything from my old fire is now on my new fire hd the device feels sturdy and well built cons the customers also bought on the bottom of the home screen is terrible i can care less about what others bought the advertisements on the lock screen are fine and understandable they really dont bother me at all or with the function of the device read more\",\"first kindly going on about two weeks now love it didn t think i d like it but i was so wrong so easy to use for a first time tablet user like me\",\"great tablet for basic use this is my first kindly since the st generation that tablet went away after a couple years kindly fire th gen is a great tablet for the money honestly i don t use it for reading i use it for browsing websites social media and listen to podcasts i use my bluetooth headphones to listen to the podcasts the couple times i ve used the speaker on the tablet i haven t been disappointed but i wasn t impressed it works just fine for watching videos in bed had no problems hearing search google for some tips and tricks to get apps from the google play store silk browser is terrible i recommend installing opera i recommend this tablet for people like me who want to just lay in bed or on the couch and doing simple tasks on the tablet don t need a or tablet to do what i m doing\",\"simply put great value great tablet let me make things simple for everyone this is a great tablet and a beautiful device it has everything of tablet users need and want the that are power users can pay up for an ipad amazon prime is a must if you have one of these tablets and if you already have amazon prime it is a no brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed people complain that one app here or there is missing if you want the tried and true the basics then you have nothing to worry about of course there is a weather app of course there is a nyt app all the normal stuff is there sure a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually want need is going to be there this is not a device for the office if you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it that goes without saying as for the actual device it feels well put together the plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me it has a solid feel the screen is beautiful and has plenty of resolution for watching movies surfing the web etc it is also sufficient for reading though the kindly paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the paperwhite also i find the word runner feature to be quite intriguing in fact i think we all may read using this method in a few years before buying the device i read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble what i have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load but we are talking a second or two max if you can t wait two seconds for something then i don t know what to say read more\",\"a great upgrade for me from an older kindly fire i purchased the original kindly fire in and the second generation kindly fire in i gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading i liked both of them and i have to tell you that they have held up very well one is over years old and the other is years old and i have not had any issues with them since i have not upgraded in years i thought i would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster cpu and a higher resolution display there are many improvements beyond even those features i have to tell you that overall i am impressed with this new one i didn t feel the need to purchase a kindly fire every year and when i purchased the next one i wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what i had i stayed with the inch size as i like to portability and weight for long term reading i alternate between the kindly paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and i use the kindly fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email this new kindly fire hd version is very fast and easy to use setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze i like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books the higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older kindly fires we own the screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older kindly fires i like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera i use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and i own many apple pads apple iphone and android tablets read more\",\"loved the concept but execution falls short and customer service was terrible i loved the concept of an reader that would not be screen time however i have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior singles i have owned first this product has no speaker of any kind so it can not play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones a big loss no current kindly reader can play audible books only older generation kindly readers or the fire which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time and sometimes my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along second it operates slowly third the freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there the categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore e g mystery biography early chapter books realistic fiction series etc but an odd collection of categories e g ballet frozen disney trucks etc most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books i would want her to read and there is no description of the book like the blurb on the amazon website so there is no way other than the title and the unhelpful category to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it finally when i called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within free time and to put books from my amazon account in the freetime library i got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent read more\",\"a star tablet updated first off i would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just i tried finding a tablet for under that would just work properly and to let you know it s impossible secondly i want to tell you how i decided to buy this tablet i first bought the inch dragon touch tablet for but to be blunt it sucked it was so slow that the web browser would always freeze even if i did a simple google search i did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after days of using it then i decided to give the kindly fire hd a chance exterior the exterior is well built no loose pieces and the plastic is very firm my previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard of course the ipad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body but it also starts at there are ports a micro usb and a headphones jack to plug in your headphones the nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find although amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable wall charger along with your kindly the previous kindly did not include them and they are worth the buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch i would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons only down side is there is no port for an sd card so you can store more memory it would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage go buy a computer display one word amazing maybe i am pushing it but the screen is so clear i own an iphone and my eyes prefer my kindly i love reading on this machine and for the price amazon did a good job with this one read more\",\"excellent rd generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition read more\",\"a nice attempt at making a truly child friendly tablet june is not only the father s day but also my older daughter s birthday she turns years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her her younger sister has fire so it was logical for us to buy fire for her as she s older we bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose than to watch cartoons my husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code there are so many different apps for that we have already tested it today when the tablet arrived but haven t shown it to our daughter yet there are three different colors and we chose the blue one as it s her favorite color it s very bright the case looks like removable foam shell very sturdy and easy to grab it s actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device it s better to go neutral there is a possibility to expand storage up to gb but i think gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter big outputs make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons as well as the charging port and headphones jack the display is ok for the price when i watched pepper pig images looked sharp and colors were vibrant even at extreme angles the sound is much better here than in fire kids edition and that s due to dual stereo speakers i don t know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter but for us it was great nothing odd or unnecessary my favorite option is parent control i can password protect purchases including in app purchases wi fi access and more read more\",\"fire in colors one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m loving my new fire i was looking for another fire and since it was not available and this is only a little larger comes in great colors and has alexa i was hooked and couldn t wait for it to arrive\",\"not just for kids i bought this for myself as my first kindly this is the best deal you can get on a kindly especially with the off if you re a prime member this is the original kindly that is that comes with a case no ads and a protection plan the case is magnetic not the greatest quality but it will do perfect for me for a year or so i connected easily to my library account and to my other books already downloaded on my kindly app it automatically connected to my amazon prime account i love it this deal will not disappoint\",\"the single best value fire in the entire line skip the fire and get the fire instead of people found this helpful was

all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you now to this model this is like a big smartphone which is a big difference from past singles it is more compact lighter and yet still very usable in fact for me the shrinking of size increases the usefulness i find that i use my smartphone way more than my tablets

ecosystem most apps that i already purchased with google play store won t work on kindly fire second i don t want to pay for same apps on another ecosystem one for apple one for google already at least amazon allows to return the product without hassle\",\"not as happy as i was with the standard hd version i ve had kindly fire s since day one and this is the only version that has slightly let me down i m having charging issues on a regular basis and occasional odd colors on the display also battery life isn t nearly what i expected if the charging issues continue i will put in for a warranty replacement\",\"kf dx is ok do homework on prime download before you buy of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no updated one year in this review is for the the no ad gb wifi only dx i use a galaxy s android smartphone so the dx is for media web surfing offline viewing for travel since i had already been using amazon prime and prime music it was a no brainer for me to use the dx to fill the role of media web surfing on a tablet be informed about the download limitations to this device amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would be purchasers make a more informed opinion this wasn t as obvious as it should have been when i ordered mine so they re listening which is good be aware that their most popular prime content may not be available to download and save to your dx you can save certain videos to your dx but you won t know which ones until you buy an dx and try it out edited you can now see a list of prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device that s an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable prime content for amazon i was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you d like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the dx also not the case so again i bought the larger capacity dx under this assumption that was dumb on my part as it turns out because you re not limited by storage capacity you re limited the number of downloads you can have on your device kids content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation but most people never will read more\",\"freetime makes me angry so so angry as the kids edition is nothing more than a basic kindly fire with some extras this review is primarily concerned with the worth of extras bundled with the kids edition primarily the year of included freetime as for the guts of the tablet itself it s fine not great but certainly fine it s not the fastest tablet it isn t the most feature rich tablet it doesn t have the shares display but it s only so it deserves to be graded on a curve for a tablet it s great now grab a coffee get comfortable because i have some thoughts on amazon s freetime service for kids parents price plus the year of freetime were the selling points for me the case and added warranty were nice bonuses the problem is freetime though fantastic in theory isn t even half baked it s a lump of dough left on the counter to rise and then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it it s getting mold and it smells kind of funny freetime great in theory terrible in practice normally when you buy a new tablet it might have a little bloatware pre installed but you generally don t start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen you find and add the apps you want the way you install remove apps in freetime is sort of backwards it s subtraction every single title is served up on the home screen and in the apps books videos screens these aren t technically pre installed but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal well he does but only sort of he clicks elm s face and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads read more\",\"great product needs a software update for a very annoying problem great device it s happy has an awesome display great sound for a tablet rivals bests any portable device i currently own including laptops has incredible ease of use and i m basically all in on the amazon ecosystem i know people lament the loss of google play but i m a simple guy who doesn t actually need absolutely everything i can watch movies videos from the major streaming services i use netflix prime music pandora spotify prime the various apps i use for fantasy sports reading emails ebooks honestly the main reason i bought this thing and reddit that s more or less all i need it to do and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly the reason for the star is because as of this review the device has the supreme annoying habit of locking up it seems to happen most often when i m running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off it occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day but this is a device that i only use when i m traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer so those times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities example of a recent situation i m waiting for my class to start so i m hanging out at the college library listening to some stuff on prime while flipping through reddit with headphones on it s time to go in so i switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag except it locks up the screen stops moving i lose any and all functions to use it and the music just keeps on playing i can t shut it off read more\",\"my kindly fired received my kindly and it was in good shape package not damaged i see the difference with the kindly fire hd compared to dx cause their isn t any one has camera and the other didn t i plan on keeping my kindly fire hd thanks amazon i love it\",\"ips screen makes all the difference in the world still no google app compatibility much improved screen it turns out that the fire version released two years ago didn t have an ips screen now it does technically both the old one and this new one are just ppi pixels per inch but this one seems much cruiser than the first generation er my eyes don t lie ips makes the screen a lot cruiser there s also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen now it holds its own with the color gamut original ipad mini before it wasn t anywhere near mind you it s not current apple screen quality or current high end samsung screen quality but what is it s only and it s good enough heck at its more than good enough it s great it blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen that s for sure i pulled out my first gen fire the one this replaces and placed it side by side with this new one the colors including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds on the old one weren t video worthy ok for casual videos on facebook and youtube maybe but not good enough for netflixing and amazon prime this new one though it s movie worthy especially with headphones ok only with headphones i d prefer p over the fire s p p is better than p dvd s but not ask good as even entry level p ndtv quality but overall even at p it s eminently watchable by the way for me streaming video content on amazon prime instant video has been noticeably sharper than streaming youtube i think amazon prime adapts to p max for this tablet while youtube is is probably delivering only p remember youtube s defaults are p p p and up read more\",\"replacing kindly dx i ve had my dx going on years i love it i needed a larger screen for my eyes i m so glad i went with the refurbished i ve only had to get used to the different op system i don t use this for gaming or movies i am an avid reader and this is awesome for increasing the size of the pages and font i did have some problems downloading my books but that s just me and my lack of kindly tech it shouldn t take me too much longer to get used to this newer system\",\"i wanted to like this tablet ended up somewhat disappointed i bought this tablet for its size economical price point and the ability to watch content offline and it offers exactly that but falls short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet large screen and the ability to watch content offline this is a great device to get however if you already have an earlier kindly like the dx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device the constant freezing of the device slow speed to load apps significant tags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network and the frequent need to reboot the device all factors made this a frustrating device to own the dx is far better in every aspect heck even the original fire runs better than this device the only good things about this device are the screen size and the micro slot so if you re only watching videos on this and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you re traveling this tablet would be just fine otherwise the dx is still a better option or you could get the or fire models those are priced cheaper and work better original review is below for the price point and size alone the fire hd would seem like a good deal for its performance however it falls short of expectations i would probably rate it a overall if it wasn t for the price the rating would have been even lower read more\",\"if you want something cheap and very durable fire kids edition is a perfect choice having a tablet or a phone is inevitable in our life and there is nothing we can do about it and i know there are toddler over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around but that s not our case our daughter is three years old and she s a very nice girl but she hates grocery shopping she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps are her favorite cartoons earlier we gave her my or my husband s phone but it s so easy for a toddler to drop things down so we made a decision to buy her a tablet the price was a trigger for us to buy fire hd kids edition we did not have the previous edition but as far as i know the only difference between them are that the th gen fire has a dual band wifi antenna and a slightly newer gpu at first we considered buying a fire regular one but there are so many benefits in the kid s edition that it s definitely worth to pay an extra for it and those benefits that were important for us are kid proof case that s a must have i chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it year worry free guarantee one year of freetime unlimited she will love all the apps and game that are free i can choose what content my daughter will watch the battery life is great my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day so it should work on a single charge for a week or so the display quality is just ok i expected it to be at least better than the previous version my nephew has it but it s just the same during the first day it has been dropped and thrown and kicked and it survived read more\",\"a star tablet updated people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no first off i would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just i tried

the price i m pleased so happy with my new fire and i wish i had bought more some of the pros of this tablet are it has alexa memory expansion slot and a nice size at inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and ebook it is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids the apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen i install the google play store and connect to the google play store to download apps is easy like youtube without the google play store you will stuck with the amazon store and apps i often use the tablet to watch videos with my meldung e bluetooth headphones meldung e anc bluetooth headphones active noise cancelling headphones wireless stereo headphones with microphone economic design for kids adult black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for this is right for you and it has two colors for choice black and rosegold i have bought two i did some research and found that the meldung company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth anc headphones vibration speakers wifi speakers no wonder their headphones sound really nice also recommend back to here the only cons i would say about that the tablet has two camera rear is mp and front is mp very very basic having two speakers but the speaker is not great overall it is a good value for the price this tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do\",\"no big improvement in the model review updated september as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing this review from the perspective of being a long time kindly user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindly the and new paperwhite the fire hd fire hd fire dx and fire dx this review is for the all new kindly paperwhite the attached picture shows the kindly on the left and the new kindly on the right here is the summary of my initial impressions of the model versus the model i am somewhat disappointed in the version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model the paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation model to its second generation model especially in the display and processor area the model came with gb storage a wonderful display a great battery and was the e book workhouse the second generation model changed by only increasing storage to gb the third generation model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly what comes in the box a paperwhite device a quick start guide and a short usb cord amazon still does not supply a power adapter size its the same identical size as the older paperwhites the weight has been reduced slightly from to ounces a fraction of an ounce most likely because of a smaller battery the good news is that all cases that fit the other paperwhites will fit the version display the resolution has been bumped up to ppi equivalent to the voyage read more\",\"the single best value fire in the entire line skip the fire

have bought one years ago love it i purchased this as i have had audible for quite some time now and thought it would be easier just to get the amazon brand for downloading from kindleprime audible and even the endless books for being a prime member and it is i have a reader also thought that was all i would ever need now wishing i would have just purchased this in the beginning being a prime member and all of the new neat things amazon is coming up with this is just way better and easier for me no doubt about it i do like all the features it has and the tech help available when you have issues if you are soon behind in the tech world as i am next kindly fire i purchase will be the gb though kind of just thought try it on for size so to speak had no idea i would truly like it so much very pleased with this purchase seems well made and durable although the kid case i purchased to go with it might be why it feels as such lol\",\"excellent rd generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition this is the middle model of the three models that amazon is shipping this year the kindly fire hd the kindly fire dx this tablet and the kindly fire dx this is the successor for last year s kindly fire hd but with an updated operating system and new features a redesigned shell with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible an absolutely amazing display superb sound an included power adapter and the new monday feature see http www amazon com review nh dom wn for my review of the kindly fire hd and http www amazon com review r ypithvtylczt for my review of the kindly fire dx update some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the dx if you search on youtube for dx blue haze you can find a video showing the issue amazon has updated their learn more link with the following info to achieve the perfect color accuracy on kindly fire dx at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight we used blue not white led blue led allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to improvement in power efficiency as a result of using these blue led you may notice a very narrow faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background such as books or web pages all displays have some level of light emission around the edges and the light on the kindly fire dx is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy if this is something that you think would bother you i d recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the dx at a local best buy or office superstar i ve also uploaded a user image here of my dx with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow http www amazon com gp customer media product gallery b dopo m the amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices best suited for connecting to the amazon ecosystem including videos music books apps and so on with the free prime trial subscription you can check out the prime instant video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for days for videos music and books the amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps much less so of the top apps are available on amazon com as well as others but that s only a small fraction of what is available with google or apple it s not quite as bad as it sounds because while the competition has ten times as many apps most of those apps are um how shall i put this less than stellar look up sturgeon s law if there are specific apps you need or want you definitely should double check before purchasing to make sure that they are available the apps that will likely never become available on the kindly fire ecosystem are those apps that require google services i e anything that uses google location services one ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side load most of the apps from the google play store onto an amazon tablet and a web search on side loading apps onto kindly fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions if the app you are sideloading requires a google service to work though it will not run on the fire even if you manage to successfully install it like the other kindly fire tablets as well as the apple ipad and the google nexus the kindly tablet line doesn t have a micro sd slot so the assumption is that you re consuming content from the cloud this is fine when you re using your tablet with wifi not so good when you re traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip if the latter is something you expect to do regularly you might want to consider the gb or gb versions or pay the additional price for the g version which is available on the tablet for the first time also if all of your content is on itunes or on google play you would have to side load everything onto the tablet as is true of apple and google tablets there s no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition something new this year is the ability to download prime instant videos i verified that i can download prime instant videos to my kindly fire dx however that option is not available for all movies and tv shows it looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes so for example i was able to download casablanca but not able to download the avengers even though both are part of the prime instant video collection and both are available for free streaming update adding a bit from a reply in the comments amazon is clearly looking at the enterprise market with this launch at least based on the details they provide they ve added full accessibility support required in order to get government contracts will be bringing support for vpn and business printing have a better email client with tighter integration to exchange and are including officesuite for productivity there are other productivity tools available in their app store as well although both google and apple particularly the latter have more options when vpn support arrives i ll definitely be taking a look as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night so how does this kindly fire dx differ from the previous generation kindly fire display x ppi vs x ppi it s more than that though as the colors are richer brighter with better contrast this display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and i would have to agree amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight while there is definitely a noticeable improvement this isn t what you need for reading on the beach for that you ll need an link reader like the kindly paperwhite sound as far as i can tell the sound is about the same this was already one of the best sounding tablets on the market with dolly stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones size and weight noticeably lighter oz vs oz and noticeably smaller x x vs x x this is a comfortable tablet to hold one handed even for long periods of time processor it s a lot faster gh quad core top of the line cpu compared to gh dual core this tablet is amazingly fast and smooth with the fastest processor in its class every game i ve tried on it has run smoothly with no hesitation slowdown or glitches scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now without the hesitation and occasional slowdown of the previous generations build a redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find this is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in that may not be an issue camera if there is a difference between last year s camera and this year s i m not able to see it it s a high def camera suitable for video conferencing or style like last year s model there is no rear camera if this is important to you you ll need the version hdi output this is the one area where last year s model wins amazon has removed the hdi out connector from its tablet line but see the description above for details on how amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television no other tablet that i m aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need you should be able to purchase one of last year s models fairly cheaply battery life the same at hours however amazon has added a special reading mode to the device which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as hours i did not test this for my own personal use the battery life is adequate price it s more expensive vs but this year they include a power adapter which was a extra last year so the actual difference in price is for what you re getting that price increase is definitely justified it has an updated os and updated feature software including the free unlimited monday customer support feature the software updates include the ability to download some prime instant videos to your device and watch them offline enhanced accessibility enhanced enterprise controls and features so now it s better suited for office work enhanced email client enhanced parental controls improved x ray features now including lyrics for music as well as additional information for both books and movies integration with goodreads coming soon and the like where i noticed the biggest difference was the home screen the default view is still the carousel but if you swine upward you ll see a more traditional icon view the recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less intrusive and it can be turned off in the settings amazon has also added multi taking of a sort where wiping up from the bottom of the screen while you re in an app shows you the most recently used items from your home screen so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen there is also a left panel available on most screens but not the home screen and in some of the apps with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app if you tap the center of your display and then swine left while you re reading a book for example you ll see a panel that shows you the table of contents the about the author link the sync to furthest page read link and so on the kindly freetime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business if you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access how long they can use the tablet at any given time and the like amazon has you covered you can now also schedule quiet time on the tablet where notification sounds and pop up notifications are disabled either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis frankly i doubt i ll ever use this feature but if you re the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep it s kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don t get widely awakened when e g someone plays a new word in your words with friends game monday this is a huge gamble by amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off this isn t a feature for a tech like me and i didn t use it although i was sorely tempted from the commercials it s pretty amazing particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less amazon s goal is something like seconds i believe although i can t help wondering what will happen on christmas day if you re thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe the addition of this feature may make the kindly fire dx your best choice how does this tablet rank against the competition there are really only two other tablets in its class currently the google nexus and the just announced apple ipad mini with retina display display all three devices have retina displays with the dx and the nexus at x ppi and the ipad mini at x ppi all three displays are stunning amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight something that s a problem for all such devices while this wouldn t be my first choice to read by the pool i d pick the paperwhite i can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors it s worth noting that the aspect ratio of the dx and nexus is while the aspect ratio of the ipad mini is where this matters is watching video if you re watching an old television show a aspect ratio is fine if you re watching a high def movie the aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the dx and nexus apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up sound the dx has dolly digital surround sound the nexus has frauenhofer surround sound the ipad mini has stereo sound the ipad mini also makes the same mistake that amazon made in its first generation tablet putting both speakers on the same side in this case at the bottom of the tablet if you re watching a video you ll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side the dx in contrast has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching networking the dx and the ipad mini both have dual band dual antenna mio wi fi the nexus is dual band but not dual antenna all things being equal i would expect the nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance particularly in areas where the connection is sports size and weight dx x x and oz nexus x x and oz ipad mini x x and oz there s really nothing to choose from here all three are small thin and light the ipad mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen processor dx gh quad core snapdragon processor gb memorynexus gh quad core snapdragon s pro gb memoryipad mini bit dual core a gb memorythe dx and ipad come out ahead of the nexus on processing power while the dx and nexus come out ahead of the ipad mini on memory the a is only a dual core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks it definitely holds its own against the quad core snapdragon these are all pretty powerful tablets cameras both the nexus and the ipad mini have mp front and mp rear cameras the dx only has a front facing camera if you expect to take pictures with your tablet the dx isn t for you battery life dx hours hours when reading nexus hours ipad mini hours amazon wins this one particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading expansion none of them have a micro slot they all assume that you ll be using their respective cloud systems parental controls all of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child s access to content purchases the web and so on amazon goes farther though with the kindly free time and kindly free time unlimited options the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content if you are buying a first tablet for a child i d choose the kindly fire hd at only it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the dx has enterprise as soon as amazon releases its update it will add vpn and network printing support i believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities including that support and various office apps for real productivity though personally i d go with a laptop not a tablet support amazon wins this category hands down with the new monday system apple comes in second with apple and amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey this is an area where google does not shine price the dx and nexus win this one hands down both are priced at vs for the new ipad mini neither google nor amazon makes much if any money on their tablets they re counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores from my own perspective there is no single clear winner as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses if you already have amazon prime the dx is a no brainer with the access to the prime instant video and the kindly owners lending library if you re primarily buying a tablet to read with amazon wins there as well with the hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors if you want apps apple and google both have far more choices if you want to watch movies i d pick either the dx or the nexus as apple s aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack if price is a factor then you should pick either the dx or the nexus if you re heavily invested in the apple ecosystem i e you already own an iphone or ipad and all of your content is on itunes the dx really isn t the tablet for you similarly if you love browsing google play for apps to play on your samsung galaxy phone you re likely to be disappointed in the section available on amazon although as i note above most of the google play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet if you love your google now or sir neither of which will ever be available on amazon this isn t the tablet for you the bottom line this tablet is primarily intended as a viewpoint into amazon content and amazon services if you have amazon prime and you have amazon ebooks in your collection this tablet is a no brainer the price is low particularly for what you get and it s a small light high quality high powered tablet with a stunning display and superb sound this really is one of the top tablets in its class note as others have noted the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi unlike some others i had no trouble with this operation no glitches or crashes it took several minutes but the process ran smoothly as did the tablet when everything was done update now that i have a kindly fire hd and a kindly fire dx tablet i m in a little better position to talk about which one i d recommend you should get the kindly fire dx if you re a tech who wants the latest and greatest the best display the fastest processor you need a camera for style or other video app you play graphics intensive games e g racing games the size and weight matter to you even in such small increments as this you think you will need the monday technical support you should get the kindly fire hd if price is a factor cheaper is not an insignificant amount this really is an excellent value for the money you want an inexpensive tablet for a child and for this case the lack of a camera might well be a plus all you want is a basic tablet for reading books playing music watching the occasional video playing words with friends and the like while the screen on the hd isn t as stunning as is it on the dx this is still a true hd screen and it is very good i check back pretty regularly so if you have a question please feel free to ask and i ll do my best to answer it read more\",\"awesome media box but i love this thing its what i have been looking for in entertainment its very fast and does gaming well but amazon slipped up when they only gave this gem gigs of storage space this is a game changer for sure but it needs at the very least gigs to fully enjoy fire tv would have loved to give fire tv stars but gigs is being cheap considering that most game titles are now legs each oh and one more thing it needs googles play store so us android users can use our paid games on this machine as well\",\"hd fire is great for the price for the low price this tablet really does more than expected the camera isn t great however i always use my phone for a camera so that doesn t effect me here are some of the pros and cons pros low cost yet high tech great screen quality of course there is better out there but it looks great as is smooth and responsive easy access to amazon prime content easy to tirelessly share content to a tv battery life web browser works creations doesn t have some apps android users are used to having camera quality isn t great and no flash less extra features than some higher priced tablets have opted to go with the gb version with no ads the ads aren t a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screen no matter what version you pick they all do the same things the gigs may or may not matter to you and gigs both aren t very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows movies music before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gig if you will always have internet connection then it isn t much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet overall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the dx series however if you want an amazing tablet but don t want to spend as much then these new hd series are great for me and my uses the hd is the perfect fit i would suggest the over the for most buyers the only things the has over the are a larger screen and dual speakers sure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than the read more\",\"a star tablet updated of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no first off i would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just i tried finding a tablet for under that would just work properly and to let you know it s impossible secondly i want to tell you how i decided to buy this tablet i first bought the inch dragon touch tablet for but to be blunt it sucked it was so slow that the web browser would always freeze even if i did a simple google search i did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after days of using it then i decided to give the kindly fire hd a chance exterior the exterior is well built no loose pieces and the plastic is very firm my previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard of course the ipad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body but it also starts at there are ports a micro usb and a headphones jack to plug in your headphones the nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find although amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable wall charger along with your kindly the previous kindly did not include them and they are worth the buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch i would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons only down side is there is no port for an sd card so you can store more memory it would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage go buy a computer display one word amazing maybe i am pushing it but the screen is so clear i own an iphone and my eyes prefer my kindly i love reading on this machine and for the price amazon did a good job with this one read

for those that just want an e reader i am enjoying it so far great for reading had the original fire since the fire used to make my eyes hurt if i read too long haven t experienced that with the paperwhite yet\",\"great update for those who use their kindly a lot i m a long time kindly user and have upgraded a number of times every upgrade was a significant improvement and the oasis continues that trend i love my voyage but the oasis makes it feel like a hardback book the pictures and descriptions don t do the size and weight justice shocking light and small even with the case used without the case it s like holding a few sheets of paper amazing haven t had it long enough to evaluate the battery life but never had a problem with the previous models so i assume the promise of much longer battery life with the secondary battery in the case is accurate the balance in the hand without the case is stunning good with the case feels a bit like the voyage although quite a bit lighter than my voyage in its case case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed screen seems a side clearer and higher definition than my voyage maybe due to the updated lighting system i had the pressure sensitive page turner option on my voyage turned off much too jump and sensitive even at its hard setting i won t miss that the new mechanical buttons on the oasis are awesome nice upgrade there and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part yes it is price i would say if you are a few hour a week reader the paperwhite is your best bet solid performance and very good price value but if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day like me the extra battery life and the balance size weight along with the slightly improved screen is well worth the money especially when spread over the life of the unit edit a few more comments now that i ve been using the oasis for a number of months read more\",\"huge upgrade from the kindly keyboard i had a kindly keyboard i still have i m not sure i m ready to part with it i m rather attached the kindly is the e reader it s fantastic i had my kindly keyboard for a couple years and i couldn t imagine reading on anything else there were times i left my kindly at work and had to read on my ipad i hated it however i found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old i wanted something new so onto the paperwhite mine was a gift i have the wifi only version why would you need the g just download several books at once and you are good to go i will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic have you watched the videos on the paperwhite it s not a traditional backlight it does not shine the light towards your eyes but rather down at the screen genius i sit at a computer all day i do not want more light shining at my eyes which is why i loved my kindly keyboard for so long i haven t had the paperwhite very long but i keep it at about a medium brightness so far i love that i can now read in bed with no other light the paperwhite is light weight it s rather small but about the same width as the kindly keyboard i put both singles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard but the font isn t smaller somehow more words are fit on the page i like the touchscreen interface i really found the keyboard keys to be tedious i kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though i loved those since they were on both sides of the kindly they were easily accessible no matter what i was doing at the time or how i was laying imo the jury is still out on whether or not i can live without those buttons so far i m doing ok but i will confess to missing them greatly read more\",\"ruined my marriage this thing has captured my wife s heart she reads every where all the time vacation on the way to church at bedside and far beyond books are so easy to get from the kindly itself it fits in her purse i have to repeat everything i always get right after this chapter do not buy this for someone you want share life with\",\"the best kindly ever and i should know i ve tried them all i have owned literally and i mean literally every kindly since the first one all the keyboard versions that followed the first one the touch the paperwhite the voyage all the fires since the first one all the different sizes from to and every gen in between i know i am a little crazy many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between fires depending on mood my last attempt was an ipad mini used only as an reader and for the first time in many years i bought books from somewhere other than amazon because i found the books experience so pleasant bottom line i was always seeking a kindly that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more stop the press i have found it lets put a little context around this i eventually migrated to the fires because although i liked the link for reading i also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn t seem to offer that the paperwhite and it s successors got closer so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory something i have always done even with real books still though what i didn t like about the link versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line i don t know whether it is just coincidence that i haven t seen that yet with the oasis or whether the amazon member font helps i like this new font a lot or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer os whatever i have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an reader first impressions not great read more\",\"a new step forward for me in reading on my kindly i have loved and used my kindly keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark i purchased a kindly fire and i also use an ipad but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindly keyboard i wanted to get a kindly paperwhite e reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money i got this because i wanted to reduce my restrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced restrain and high clarity and contrast of the text i have added a video of the kindly paperwhite compared to a kindly keyboard and a kindly fire if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear i use the kindly because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it the kindly has brought back that reading experience and now with the cruiser text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment i laid my kindly keyboard and the new kindly paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding with better contrast lighting and custom designed fonts the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e reader before with ppi pixels per inch this screen provides a by pixel screen that just makes the old kindly keyboard look old fashioned technology certainly does move quickly on read more\",\"i wanted a dedicated e reader and that s what i got people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m a first time kindly owner so i have nothing to compare the latest kindly to i don t own a book i don t own an ipad and in any case that s comparing apples to oranges i don t have a sony e reader this will be a short simple review i received my kindly about a week ago and haven t been able to put it down things i like about my kindly the e ink display is amazing using the way controller is simple and effective page turn speeds are faster than i thought they would be it s lightweight even with the attached cover i have an amazon cover with a built in light page turning buttons are quiet and well placed recharge time is fast i can order a book and start reading it in less than seconds nice portability i can take books with me when i travel for work and not require additional suitcase or baggage fees things i m not too keen on buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly lack of individual number buttons is frustrating power button on the bottom not a bad thing just an odd thing same for the headphones input i usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when i read things i hope change in the future how books are organized when i put a book in a collection which is actually a tag it still appears in the main list it s not actually moved it s merely associated the look of the main screen i d like folders or some other way to display collections ability to create personal screen saves e book pricing though amazon has little control over this still most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback paperback counterparts read more\",\"kindly vs book updated update november br br my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as amazon calls it now there are newer models the basic cheap kindly and the kindly touch and of course the kindly fire quasi tablet br br each of these models is an excellent choice whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences br br the e ink singles are kindly keyboard this one kindly touch the newest flagship model and the basic kindly all of them have exactly the same display with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no restrain the kindly keyboard is the oldest of these models and i got one of the first ones when they came out in august br br i still absolutely love my kindly keyboard and use it almost every day i have read dozens of books on it i like the newer models they have some neat features but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my year old kindly keyboard page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest singles but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading in my opinion br br the touch screen interface of the kindly touch is pretty neat but unlike my ipad i only use my kindly to read books and reading books is just as nice on any of the current kindly models i don t consider the touch screen a must have feature and i m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product i own br br for that reason i think the cheapest kindly is an excellent choice read more\",\"worth the money not perfect but very very good for start to finish novels in good light of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no the kindly is my first e ink reader i own an ipad an iphone and have owned a windows based phone in the past that i used as an reader my overall impression of the device is good the good i d honestly rather read linear read from page one to the end one page at a time fiction from it than a book because i can t always get comfortable with a book hardcover are sometimes a bit heavy and paperback don t always lie open easily the kindly is incredibly light and thin i can hold it in one hand easily the page turn buttons are conveniently located page turns aren t instant but they re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book there are just a lot more page turns unless you choose a small font the contrast is better than other readers i ve seen there is zero eye strain in good light my eyesight isn t the greatest and i like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses i love being able to browse the kindly store and read samples before deciding to purchase the experimental browser is surprisingly usable but isn t great it is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs the biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation using the way pad it sync your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iphone or ipad the so so the kindly store could use more categories and sorting options you can t sort by top rated and there is no category for alternate histories for example finding a very specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches which don t do a great job the wifi sometimes doesn t connect before it times out read more\",\"great entry level reader i travel for work more and more i find myself leaving the kindly fire at home and traveling with just an e ink kindly so when i broke my kindly i decided to replace it with this entry level kindly without special offers what s good smallest lightest e ink kindly available still has the page turn buttons like all the e ink singles this thing has amazing battery life what s just ok only gb memory more is better then again after two years of buying books i m nowhere near filling this thing up text entry using the way switch works but that s about all i m surprised it works well enough that i can t consider it a negative what s not so good the lighted cover costs nearly as much as the kindly anyone thinking of picking up this kindly and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight the new singles look awesome but they don t take anything away from this kindly it may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less the kindly is exactly what i need for traveling it works wonderfully as a basic no fills e reader reviewing it as such i have to give it five stars\",\"facts to consider when buying this kindly instead of others first off i received my new kindly this morning i previously owned the kindly keyboard but actually really didn t like the keyboard or the way the buttons were pressed together i m not a fan of touch screens so i bought this one there are a few things to know about this particular kindly that can help you decide if it s right for you here is a list of things to know about this kindly you ll be using an onscreen keyboard with the way controller this is not a problem for setting up wifi and a little writing but if you are an avid note taker or do a lot of writing with your kindly you might want to opt for the kindly keyboard no audio if you are planning on listening to audiobook mp s or text to speech on your kindly this is not the device for you there is not even a headphones jack so there is absolutely no audio support gb this device has gb of storage which is half of all the others if you seriously need to keep over books or so on your kindly you should opt for one of the others all of which have gb i only keep a hundred or so books on mine and the rest are up in the amazon cloud waiting for convenient download there s no g version but the wifi works just fine there is a shorter battery life amazon reports the battery life is only one month of reading compared with the others that clock in at two months if you are going to be away from electricity for over a month first of all respect second of all you may want a kindly that has the month battery life it s lighter than all the other versions it weighs in at just under oz g the closest competition is the kindly touch which is about oz it has buttons on the face at the bottom read more\",\"must have these are great this is my second paperwhite and second charger thinking about a third fourth because while putting fiction on one and non fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a kindly dedicated just to recipes another to health books etc would be marvelous\",\"a great addition to the kindly range i already had an original kindly paperwhite and loved it buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but i am so pleased i made this move i love the new font and the clarity of the screen i love that the kindly comes to life when i open the cover i bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp while there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the kindly there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel i have made a great purchase which i am happy with i also have a bunch of books from my amazon co uk site which i access on my old kindly i couldn t work out how if at all i can move books from one amazon jurisdiction to another so this has proved a good purchase all round\",\"i sent this one back and if you eat or couch read the voyage works best i am a fairly gracious reader books year almost all on kindly i have purchased every kindly edition as soon as it was announced the price doesn t bother me too much as i figure with as much as i read i make the money back by buying kindly vs hardcover books since i mostly read new releases this is the first kindly that i sent back though it s not that the oasis isn t great it is the display is slightly cruiser than previous singles it s not that it isn t set up well the buttons are placed well and easy to use and the touch screen works fine it s really just a matter of personal preference i love to read while i have coffee in the morning and while i m eating lunch at work and because of that i love the origami case that the voyage has it s hard to read the oasis hands free especially if you are used to the voyage also when reading while laying down i switch hands unconscious a couple of times a minute i didn t realize this until i used the oasis because with the oasis you have to flip the kindly over which may not seem like a big deal but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience so if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the voyage if you want the best looking read then the oasis is great and regardless you are better off reading any kindly than you are watching the garbage on tv\",\"great entry level reader people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i travel for work more and more i find myself leaving the kindly fire at home and traveling with just an e ink kindly so when i broke my kindly i decided to replace it with this entry level kindly without special offers what s good smallest lightest e ink kindly available still has the page turn buttons like all the e ink singles this thing has amazing battery life what s just ok only gb memory more is better then again after two years of buying books i m nowhere near filling this thing up text entry using the way switch works but that s about all i m surprised it works well enough that i can t consider it a negative what s not so good the lighted cover costs nearly as much as the kindly anyone thinking of picking up this kindly and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight the new singles look awesome but they don t take anything away from this kindly it may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less the kindly is exactly what i need for traveling it works wonderfully as a basic no fills e reader reviewing it as such i have to give it five stars\",\"seamless reading experience almost like reading a real book don t is crisp sharp and easy to read i ve held out from buying a reader for years because i could never quite get past the fact it wasn t a book with this new kindly i don t even notice i am immediately immersed wildly better than i expected\",\"paperwhite voyage no regrets i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friends who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have ppi so the dollar jump turns out price the voyage s page press isn t always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you don t need auto light adjustment it s been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regrets the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it s not hard to change the setting either as you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery was on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about customs which i may have if i used a third party shipping service\",\"almost like paperwhite v all over again i ve got mixed feelings on this one unfortunately this review is coming from a kindly enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the st generation size weight it s noticeably smaller and lighter than the paperwhite when i saw the specs it didn t really strike me as something that would make much difference to me but in real life it s actually great the voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into origami cover i know there s a separate product page for the origami cover but it s worth mentioning here as it is the official cover the origami cover is ugly and i was skeptical but i actually love it it s weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a noted this actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open in my opinion it s hard to describe but there are a lot more ways to hold the voyage when it s attached to this cover and just generally is more comfortable to use the origami part of the case works great as well it stands vertically or horizontally if you re laying down and reading this is amazing the other great new thing about this case is that the voyage attaches to it magnetically it attaches and detached very easily unlike the paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case this is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light thin it is without a case attached it s super easy to take it out it s price but worth it pagepress one of the new features is pagepress which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages read more\",\"because i like it but feel it s overpriced according to the info the paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a kindly but i think any brand will work it came in a package deal when i bought my paperwhite otherwise i would ve skipped it used what i ve been using for my old kindly i gave it stars because i like it but feel it s overpriced\",\"kindly vs book updated people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no update november my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as amazon calls it now

a first paperwhite not worthy of an upgrade of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this review is for the second generation kindly paperwhite like all kindly e readers before it this is a great product however i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year s model for this review i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year s model also i found something misrepresented or confusing in the advertising so i will try to clear them up hardwaredesign the kindly white has a nice look and shape it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand it s fairly light so it doesn t tire the hands too much i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite almost identical the height and width are the same the buttons are in the same location and although this version is slightly lighter it is not noticeable display although not a huge improvement from last year s model the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite like most e readers the paperwhite uses digital ink technology this model employs a more advanced version in addition the lighting has been upgraded so among other things it is more evenly lit together they make for incredible viewing in my opinion it s one of the best digital ink e reader display on the market i really enjoy reading on it text look very sharp and crisp with little to no eye strain processor the paperwhite has an upgraded processor which means smoother page turns and navigation i am able to open books flip pages and navigate menus fairly quickly there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time also the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all read more\",\"love hate relationship i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and i suppose ive read on average a book every three days for the past however many years on it i wouldnt give it up you have to try it from my cold dead fingers for sunday logistical reasons ive also made good use of amazon kindly app on my iphone no paperwhite screen naturally and all the cool usability that delivers but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the kindly of course there are aspects of the paperwhite which i would like to critique ah you knew that was coming somewhere didnt you as a member of bookbub i get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres i take on many of them however ive found that even with the best will in the world i cant keep up some days it seems that for every book i read ive bought two theres just so much good stuff out there the accumulation effect of this is that the number of books actually on my paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time its now at about with this in mind ive noticed that while page turning has remained exactly the same just about every other action on the kindly has become positively glacial not just very slow but so slow you think its malfunctioning the general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a kindly it will begin to behave in a flakes manner this drives me mad amazon states it can hold thousands of books i believe them but i figure i would need a second paperwhite to read while im waiting for actions to complete on the first one read more\",\"quite the steal this is quite the steal as already pointed out the total value is at the price this is a great deal i was able to use the recent prime off offer to get this for i bought this to have a kindly to keep in my bag my regular kindly is the voyage but i ve owned several other singles k to oasis i compared the two screens with the same setup and the only thing i noticed is that the curve of the letters is sharper on the voyage but that was expected does it have a frontlight no but as long as you know what to expect you shouldn t be surprised no light no buttons but it also isn t advertised to have those features\",\"kindly vs book updated of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no update november my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as amazon calls it now there are newer models the basic cheap kindly and the kindly touch and of course the kindly fire quasi tablet each of these models is an excellent choice whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences the e ink singles are kindly keyboard this one kindly touch the newest flagship model and the basic kindly all of them have exactly the same display with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no restrain the kindly keyboard is the oldest of these models and i got one of the first ones when they came out in august i still absolutely love my kindly keyboard and use it almost every day i have read dozens of books on it i like the newer models they have some neat features but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my year old kindly keyboard page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest singles but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading in my opinion the touch screen interface of the kindly touch is pretty neat but unlike my ipad i only use my kindly to read books and reading books is just as nice on any of the current kindly models i don t consider the touch screen a must have feature and i m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product i own for that reason i think the cheapest kindly is an excellent choice read more\",\"i love this little e reader there are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here so i though i would add my positive one i had a second generation kindly many years ago and it has since stopped working i finally decided to buy a new one i chose the basic kindly because that s exactly what i wanted a bare bones e reader i have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort this kindly delivers on that front in every way possible at first i thought i would miss the page turn buttons and dislike the touch screen however i have been delightful surprised tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button which was always a nice little jarring reminder that i wasn t in fact reading a paperback the small quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and i don t notice it anymore it feels natural i do slightly miss the metal backing of the older singles it made them feel a bit studies whereas this basic kindly is just hard plastic however i suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably and i feel that the cheaper price of this basic kindly far outweighs that slight drawback i bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers i do not want ads including my kindly experience even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the home screen it is just distasteful to me and the extra was worth it to me to avoid the ads i do not need or want a case for my kindly i do not like to read with a case on and it would be cumbersome to remove my kindly from its case every time i want to read read more\",\"love my singles i have now owned singles and just love them my first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse i had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank i then got kindly fires i gave one to my daughter and kept the other i have had no problem with the fire once i broke down and read some of the direction if all else fails other than operator error i have used it for over a year but it s too heavy for my old overuse hands not heavy though books now give me problems even paperback but i then bought the smaller lighter new kindly and loved it from the first i carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months i called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one this time i bought a light weight cover for it i don t like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it i have to protect it i have had this one for months and have had no problems i now have about books awaiting my pleasure i just looked the singles over again i m getting paranoid about my little kindly and am considering having an on site backup although amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days still giving it thought basically i love my singles and use both of my current ones for different apps\",\"charger has worked well for charging my voyage comes charger has worked well for charging my voyage comes as a separate purchase from the voyage which i found think it should be bundledwith the purchase price of the kindly voyage\",\"give this to a book loving new tommy who breastfeeds people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no as reviewed by the wife this is the perfect thing for a new tommy who loves to read books as soon as i had my baby girl i had to stop reading my novels because i had to give the baby my full attention but how much time do i spend laying in bed on my side with the baby while she feeds especially prior to months when feeding took as long as minutes not to mention cluster feeds during growth sports a book was out of the question because it s soon tiring to hold up in side lying breastfeeding position my new kindly was the solution it s light easy to disinfect i use baby wives on the case whenever i feel like it s not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby and you don t need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing you know what i mean and for some reason it s much easier to go through a book with a kindly compared to an actual book i never thought i d be converted into the kindly culture but here we are\",\"no off button i would have rated this higher stars but i am taking off stars for not having an off or a sleep mode button it is supposed to go to sleep after minutes but mine has not gone to sleep much since plugging it in a few days ago so far it is only a slight improvement over my lg blu ray players which allows me to watch amazon videos i only see a few interesting games so i will continue using my xbox and my kindly tablets until more games are available for the price i could have waited\",\"two stars too\",\"adequate i do find this better than the cheaper version i bought initially at staples it charges faster but not as fast as the kindly charger that i had used for a couple years before it finally gave out also it is not possible to charge and still use your kindly something i was able to do with the previous charger a feature i really miss still better than the alternative\",\"potentially a nice complement to a kindly paperwhite had i not purchased a paperwhite first i could easily settle on the dx as a reader as well as a color tablet the size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference the dx is slightly larger and about ounces heavier i can hold the the dx in my left hand quite comfortably just not quite as comfortably as the paperwhite moreover the text of the paperwhite seems to wear longer on older tired eyes especially after reading the hype on behalf of e ink text than that of the dx at least during extended stretches of continuous reading still there are moments when my eyes grave color images and videos beyond which the paperwhite can deliver the television set cable and roku box are my wife s and i m no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an ipod screen all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the dx it offers the freedom and privacy of an ipod but with video footage that offers a welcome size advantage compared to the ipod screen for traveling purposes i m good with the paperwhite and an ipod both pocket sized and answering to my reading listening and occasional viewing needs the speakers of the dx may be stereo but they re far from full frequencies perhaps only slightly better than those of a new ipod touch so i d recommend headphones when using either an ipod or the dx as a music player or if your partner won t complain a good adjunct speaker with a supply light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivity than dice bluetooth technology offers i frankly can t see an ipod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera i m one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated point and shoot camera but the price point of the dx makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses i ve met people who no longer use any sort of computer doing all of their facebooking e mail and banking with a mere tablet usually an apple ipad or mini my sense is that the dx would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes apple s tablet has the refined processor continually upgraded os and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of pitching their laptops aside from the added cost of the apple tablet twice as much as the dx i m simply not excited about tablets in general the affordability of the dx which has now got several years of refinement behind it makes it the preferred choice in my case in conclusion i ve got to rate the paperwhite for my particular uses as well as for amazon s scoring a game changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first apple ipod in and the facebook air in though it was not accepted by the general public until apple s decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in not only is the paperwhite small versatile fast loading and beautifully back lit no more tumbling around and experimenting with various clip on lights but there s no subscription charge for long distance connectivity to amazon and i find it measuring that amazon includes an official no charge on line user s manual for printing out on a mac computer with the dx on the other hand there appears to be no single authoritative and free user s guide instead your choices for instructions are unlimited and i would advise against proceeding intuitively especially if you plan to make use of amazon s uniquely integrated film commentary thanks largely to below head and timely purchase of the popular imdb reference source it may be no drone but in all other respects it stands alone\",\"wonderful very useful for those who enjoy reading and inspiring those who do not have a habit of reading needed for anyone not yet\",\"i love it i have to say upfront i don t like corporate hermetically closed stuff like anything by apple or in this case amazon i like having devices on which i can put anything i want and use it but i was a fairly happy user of a book touch for several years but couldn t use all its functionalities since i live in serbia then i lost the book and since no other devices can actually be fully used in serbia buying books with them using their online capabilities except the kindly and since no one except amazon ships to serbia and since i ve actually been a happy amazon customer since over friends accounts and since through my own and since the kindly definitely has the best technology why not buy its i did what i read in many reviews about the screen light of the paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine the light dispersed just fine except a few black blotches maybe you can see it in the picture at the bottom of the screen which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can t really be avoided as you can see in the picture without the light there are no blotches with light out the paperwhite s screen is just marvelous at ppi the touchscreen works just fine the store works here in serbia and in these two days i ve been using it i m a happy guy i had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like amazon books but that s fine that s the one thing i d like to see amazon do in some future upgrades make the kindly treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly with sharing function quotes and goodreads enabled and so on the size is perfect it sits very well in the hand the light doesn t hurt the eyes in the dark like the light on a tab does the packaging was fine no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life so far i can only recommend it\",\"one simply could not ask for more people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no allow me to preface this with a little history i am was a casual reader who owned a book simple touch from i ve read the harry potter series girl with the dragon tattoo series brave new world and a few other key titles fair to say my book did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs fast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindly paperwhite and i have to admit i m in love not just with the kindly but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindly the investment of is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindly you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the book that hindered me for the past years i was never inspired to pick it up get it into my hands and just dive in there was never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply odore my kindly if you are considering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week downloaded books and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left as well make yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you\",\"new kindly buyer thinking about book read on people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i got my first kindly this is a nice ebook reader i m going to jump right in and tell you what i found to be its pros and cons then i m going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor the barnes noble book simple touch kindly s pros great screen many people do not find lcdb hard to read on e g smartphones tablets kindly fire book color etc but virtually everyone will find e ink easier to read any time of day especially the newest e ink pearl displays they simply look like paper and ink i have never experienced any eye strain reading e ink book readers but i have with lcd based phone tablet screens thin and lightweight this kindly is thinner than any paperback and lighter too this makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position and for long periods too it also makes it easy to transport in a purse backpack or messenger bag or in luggage for traveling many people like to take a few books when travelling and this kindly lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden good value even without a touchscreen the kindly is a good value it is a well made product it offers cloud storage of your books and well it should since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add in micro card the screen is excellent amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing the kindly is the best value of amazon s e ink readers some may be tempted to get the version with the built in light if you can afford it sure go ahead but let me point out you don t have to spend for a fancy schmancy book light your local dollar store has them for wait for it a buck read more\",\"two stars very overpriced\",\"kindly vs book updated update november my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as

had to think hard about ordering the new voyage i was very happy with my paperwhite the nd generation that was released in the fall of and as much as i wanted to try the voyage i wasn t sure i wanted to spend on one it became a moot point though when my wife ordered the voyage saying it was her early christmas present to me now that i ve had time to use the voyage i have to say i m impressed with hardware features like a ppi display led that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting and the user s choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages the voyage is hands down the state of the art e ink ebook reader at the end of my review i ll give my opinion on whether it s worth upgrading from your current ebook reader when i received the voyage the setup was quick although you do have to go through a brief tutorial and after downloading a few of my books from the amazon cloud and adjusting a few settings the voyage was ready to go

finish novels in good light the kindly is my first e ink reader i own an ipad an iphone and have owned a windows based phone in the past that i used as an reader br br my overall impression of the device is good br br the good br i d honestly rather read linear read from page one to the end one page at a time fiction from it than a book because i can t always get comfortable with a book hardcover are sometimes a bit heavy and paperback don t always lie open easily the kindly is incredibly light and thin i can hold it in one hand easily the page turn buttons are conveniently located page turns aren t instant but they re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book there are just a lot more page turns unless you choose a small font the contrast is better than other readers i ve seen there is zero eye strain in good light my eyesight isn t the greatest and i like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses i love being able to browse the kindly store and read samples before deciding to purchase the experimental browser is surprisingly usable but isn t great it is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs the biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation using the way pad it sync your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iphone or ipad br br the so so br the kindly store could use more categories and sorting options you can t sort by top rated and there is no category for alternate histories for example finding a very specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches which don t do a great job the wifi sometimes doesn t connect before it times out read more\",\"a superb e ink reader but is it worth the money okay if you don t want to read my whole review i ll summarize it right here the oasis is the most technologically advanced e ink reader that amazon or anyone else for that matter has produced to date but is it worth for the least expensive version wi fi only with ads in my opinion the answer is no not when the very capable paperwhite is available for at the time i m writing this but i m sure that there is a market for the oasis probably for the techno geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the oasis and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading but for the typical reader i just don t think the oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price especially for those who already have a paperwhite or voyage for reference here s a brief comparison of the

wrong with a wall charger purchase works great just as expected the kindly doesn t need to charge very often but i use this all the time for my phone nice to have a charger in more than one room\",\"best kindly so far people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i bought the first kindly when it came out and while i liked it i didn t use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use the second generation kindly was a lot better but i still preferred to read physical books with the kindly being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space i still buy physical books but most are donated to the local library salvation army etc after i ve read them next about a year after it came out i bought what amazon called the kindly keyboard and was hooked i began using the kindly as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the kindly keyboard couldn t be improved upon i ve since given a couple as gifts i liked the storage capacity the g capability and thought i wouldn t want to be without the keyboard after reading more than seventy books on it i couldn t imagine trying a kindly with less memory and only wi fi i was wrong i ordered this th generation kindly earlier this year thinking i d have it for a backup to my kindly keyboard instead it has become my much preferred device storage room with the cloud it s really not an issue i keep a few reference books on both of my current singles the keyboard and this one as well as what i m currently reading i haven t had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity while it would be nice to have g it s not a deal killer at all i ve already read close to books on this kindly and i ve only found myself without easy access to wi fi once when i m close to finishing a book i plan ahead and download a new one or two so that i m ready wherever i happen to be read more\",\"it is a pretty large charger though and doesn t fit in the kindly very expensive charger i think the kindly should come with it as does all other tablets including the fire which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just it is a pretty large charger though and doesn t fit in the kindly box with the kindly at all\",\"good as a first paperwhite not worthy of an upgrade this review is for the second generation kindly paperwhite like all kindly e readers before it this is a great product however i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year s model for this review i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year s model also i found something misrepresented or confusing in the advertising so i will try to clear them up hardwaredesign the kindly white has a nice look and shape it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand it s fairly light so it doesn t tire the hands too much i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite almost identical the height and width are the same the buttons are in the same location and although this version is slightly lighter it is not noticeable display although not a huge improvement from last year s model the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite like most e readers the paperwhite uses digital ink technology this model employs a more advanced version in addition the lighting has been upgraded so among other things it is more evenly lit together they make for incredible viewing in my opinion it s one of the best digital ink e reader display on the market i really enjoy reading on it text look very sharp and crisp with little to no eye strain processor the paperwhite has an upgraded processor which means smoother page turns and navigation i am able to open books flip pages and navigate menus fairly quickly there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time also the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all read more\",\"w or v a q what s the difference between a amazon w usb official oem charger and power supply and a v a ma usb port power supply ul listed calling it a w charger rather than a v a charger is a distinction without a difference\",\"i love it i love my kindly i got one for my fiance on his birthday he loved it so i decided to get one for myself as well and i am glad i did it is very easy to read books in it i love the dictionary on this little device normally i just skip a word i don t know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindly i just press and hold my finger on the word i don t know and translation pops up so essentially the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips if you love to read books i highly recommend kindly however if you only read manga or comic books if you are a fan of buying how to draw how to sew books i do not recommend kindly for you it is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides so if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now if you are a manga fan just buy your manga books from bookstores\",\"not the perfect do it all device but very close to being the perfect e reading device i woke up to a nice surprise this morning a new kindly as a gift i have an ipad and a kindly dx but i guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended reading on don t get me wrong i absolutely love my ipad and dx but this new generation of kindly is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time the ipad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritated my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours the dx was my go to device for those extended outdoor reading periods but now i have a new friend for reading novels instead of a replacement this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class the ipad works great for web browsing shopping productivity games etc while the kindly falls short in those areas the kindly works great for reading novels where the ipad falls short for those that love to do extended reading of magazines newspapers research articles etc i find that the dx is the go to device br br without a doubt the size and weight of the new kindly is the biggest draw for me it s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin i ve played around with the kindly and was impressed but now looking at the size of the new kindly i m blown away it s the absolute perfect size smaller would be manageable and larger wouldn t feel nearly as good this is a device that you can hold up read and just forget that it s there compared to other e readers i ve tried it s much smaller and much lighter br br one of my biggest complaints about the previous generation singles and the dx is the speed it sometimes takes a while after you push next page for it to actually change read more\",\"five stars super sturdy and easy for little hands to hold\",\"i m very glad that i made this purchase i m very glad that i made this purchase i don t often bring my computer with me when i travel i enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the paperwhite\",\"do you just want to read a book than this is the kindly for you i have owned a kindly for several years now i have had the nd generation kindly and i have had the kindly keyboard when my mom expressed interest in getting a kindly i decided to give her my kindly keyboard because she doesnt have wifi in her house and my older kindly keyboard had g which is what she needed and i decided to buy the basic kindly for myself because i didnt want to wait for the paperwhite to come out and i just needed wifi and and most importantly i just want to read a book not listen to text to speech or go shopping on amazon or listen to music etc all i want to do is read a book thats it this kindly is perfect for that its smaller and lighter the pages turn faster than the keyboard version it basically has everything i need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the paperwhite or keyboard yes you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindly with a way controller but i rarely use the keyboard anyway to download a book i just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my kindly which is much quicker no matter what version of kindly you have so if you dont need want or use all the extras then i would definitely recommend the basic kindly for with special offers because who really pays attention to the screen saves anyway\",\"i have read some of the previous reviews and you shouldn t believe everything that is written first i m a die hard kindly user and love every single one i have owned this one is incredibly light weight i bought the kindly fire hd before this one and even though i loved it it was pretty heavy the screen resolution is incredible it s crystal clear and just looks amazing now i kind of was debating waiting for the to come out but this inch is the prefect size to throw in my purse i read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading i don t have that and find that reading a book with this kindly is easy on the eyes i haven t used the monday button yet but i m sure it s up to par with amazon s wonderful customer service i m unsure what else to say but that you will be highly impressed with this kindly\",\"great for those that just want an e reader people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i am enjoying it so far great for reading had the original fire since the fire used to make my eyes hurt if i read too long haven t

this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no my new kindly paperwhite came from the usa to a small town in sweden in just five days payment of tax and customs handled by amazon had not the ups been so square they think everyone sits at home all day i had received it a day earlier i am very pleased with the e reader easy on the eyes and comfortable to hold in one hand even if i buy many books from amazon i also want to read books in the pub format a positive surprise was how easy it is to convert pub format to amazon s own format i use the program calibre and then i just send the book as an attachment in an e mail to my kindly quick and easy\",\"five stars nice controller\",\"three stars love it but way to expensive\",\"know what you are buying redux if you read the know what you are buying review for the kindly prior to this one then you know where i am going already this new kindly is riddled with one star reviews from people that seem to not have read the product description here goes this kindly does not have a light this kindly does not have gaming capability this kindly does not have page turning buttons like a regular book you just might have a hard time reading this kindly in bed at night with low lighting what you will get though is an awesome entry level kindly with software almost identical to the higher end models the print looks flawless outside by a window or under a lamp in other words just like a real book\",\"this is my second kindly i also have a g kindly touch and of the two i prefer the touch overall features i like about the fire i love and hate the carousel all at the same time i love how easy it is to scan through the books that i have on my kindly and seeing the pictures of the covers because sometimes i like to pick my books based solely on the cover i don t like how every book i purchase shows up on the carousel whether i ve sent it to the fire or not there may be a way to stop that from happening but i haven t figured it out yet if there is i really like having my fire connected to my goodreads account so that when i finish reading a book on the fire and write a review for amazon it also posts to goodreads for me without any extra work on my part i also like being able to read on my fire without an additional light source i do not like the glare on the screen while trying to read in sunlight for me the fire has been basically useless anywhere that sunlight is involved which includes car rides on sunny days as the sun shining through the car windows creates too much glare to read i ve seen some people mention a way to sort of solve that problem but i have yet to figure out how to do it and instead just take my touch with me if i m going to possibly anywhere near sunlight\",\"it s wonderful i never give stars because there is nothing in life that is perfect and you really don t know if there s a problem until you ve used something for several months this kindly meets all of my expectations and seems to be working just great\",\"more evolutionary than revolutionary but worth the upgrade this is the fifth e ink kindly reader that i ve bought my wife and i were early adapters of kindly and when we buy a new kindly the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line i loved the original paperwhite with its small size touch screen front lighting and virtual keyboard the all new paperwhite is a definite step up and for me it was worth the move but others will have to decide for themselves if you read a lot and you don t already have one of the newer e ink singles it s definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite if you have the original paperwhite the upgrade is well worth considering although i ve only had the new paperwhite a few hours i m already glad i upgraded here s a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite size it s the same size as the original paperwhite x x the weight has been reduced slightly from ounces to ounces the paperwhite is

case i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic automate function it s much easier to turn the kindly on and off without tumbling for the small power switch lighting the front lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located it didn t bother me but some readers were annoyed by

the dragon tattoo series brave new world and a few other key titles fair to say my book did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs fast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindly paperwhite and i have to admit i m in love not just with the kindly but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindly the investment of is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindly you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the book that hindered me for the past years i was never inspired to pick it up get it into my hands and just dive in there was never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply odore my kindly if you are considering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week downloaded books and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left as well make yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you\",\"detailed review of the kindly as has been the case for years amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the kindly this one is no exception if you ve used a kindly in the past you re not going to notice much of a change with this one but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth i ll briefly go over them screen the new kindly is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray off white paper looking background it s certainly not bright white but it s also not lcd looking dark gray it does not have buttons for page turning as the older generations do if you simply must have the page turning buttons please search for the older singles that offer that one last thing regarding the screen this is not a kindly paperwhite or voyage where you have a back lit screen this has an unit off white kindly screen i will say the text is noticeably cruiser and bolder than i ve seen with previous generation singles and i believe that s because amazon is using e ink s new carta displays instead of the previously used pearl displays i love that and have been waiting for years for e ink the taiwan based company that makes the kindly screens for amazon to improve them it looks like they re finally getting it the new kindly s screen resolution is ppi which is slightly lower than the kindly paperwhite which is ppi and substantially lower than the kindly voyage which boasts an impressive ppi individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye price wise though the base model paperwhite runs at the time of this review and the voyage base model runs so you can see the more you pay the better the resolution and features ppi is fine though read more\",\"not the perfect do it all device but very close to being the perfect e reading device i woke up to a nice surprise this morning a new kindly as a gift i have an ipad and a kindly dx but i guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended reading on don t get me wrong i absolutely love my ipad and dx but this new generation of kindly is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time the ipad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritated my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours the dx was my go to device for those extended outdoor reading periods but now i have a new friend for reading novels instead of a replacement this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class the ipad works great for web browsing shopping productivity games etc while the kindly falls short in those areas the kindly works great for reading novels where the ipad falls short for those that love to do extended reading of magazines newspapers research articles etc i find that the dx is the go to device without a doubt the size and weight of the new kindly is the biggest draw for me it s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin i ve played around with the kindly and was impressed but now looking at the size of the new kindly i m blown away it s the absolute perfect size smaller would be manageable and larger wouldn t feel nearly as good this is a device that you can hold up read and just forget that it s there compared to other e readers i ve tried it s much smaller and much lighter one of my biggest complaints about the previous generation singles and the dx is the speed it sometimes takes a while after you push next page for it to actually change read more\",\"more evolutionary than revolutionary but worth the upgrade of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this is the fifth e ink kindly reader that i ve bought my wife and i were early adapters of kindly and when we buy a new kindly the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line i loved the original paperwhite with its small size touch screen front lighting and virtual keyboard the all new paperwhite is a definite step up and for me it was worth the move but others will have to decide for themselves if you read a lot and you don t already have one of the newer e ink singles it s definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite if you have the original paperwhite the upgrade is well worth considering although i ve only had the new paperwhite a few hours i m already glad i upgraded here s a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite size it s the same size as the original paperwhite x x the weight has been reduced slightly from ounces to ounces the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand which is how i usually read the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite it will also fit the new one thank you amazon if you buy a

kindly well i had mixed opinions on it you might want to read my review of the paperwhite here http www amazon com review r z sdfocz z refcmcrrdppermbottom line is that the kindly e ink display is for the money an amazing product unless you really do a lot of reading in bed or in dark rooms you don t need the paperwhite at nearly twice the cost i actually returned my paperwhite due to all the screen issues my review of the paperwhite describes all you need to know update september new firmware is available for the kindly it is version as i write this it brings some notable improvements to the kindly experience new features in this update include improved reading font that is higher contrast and cruiser so that you can enjoy a paper like reading experience parental controls that allow you to restrict access to the experimental web browser archived items and the kindly store support for books with complex layouts and formats with kindly format support for children s books with

this is the third kindly i have bought i bought one for my father and now this one is for my girlfriend one little known feature of the kindly is your get your own kindly com email address when you buy one you can use this email address to email books to yourself or to other people i routinely download mob and pub books online and email them to myself and to my dad and soon my girlfriend within seconds they will magically appear on your kindly s home page\",\"i was very happy with my paperwhite and would not have bought this since other people have gone into detail on the device i will answer only the burning questions i had before i received mine i was very happy with my paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen lost not sure which my husband still has his paperwhite so i was able to compare them side by side can i use the wall charger from my paperwhite to charge the voyages can pressing the page turner cause repetitive use issues don t think so you can turn down the pressure it needs which is very slight or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap it s actually nice to have both options can you see where to turn the pages in the dark you can guess where the page forward area is but the page back is a dot so guessing would be difficult but you can still tap to turn pages using a cover helps as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot does the feedback buzz annoy you when you turn pages think it does take a little getting used to but you can turn it down and i think i will not notice it after a while there s no sound it s purely tactile months later it s not distracting you forget about it is the adjustable light nice still do it manually it doesn t adjust the way i d like it to not as bright in good light as i d like and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me note that if you want to use the night light you have to set that separately from auto adjust settings device options screen light i

found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no these are great this is my second paperwhite and second charger thinking about a third fourth because while putting fiction on one and non fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a kindly dedicated just to recipes another to health books etc would be marvelous\",\"great charger one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this is a great charger i like it better than the square ones\",\"liked the smaller size had older model that you could text to speech this one hasn t liked the smaller size but having to buy a different cover still getting used to shelf quite different from my year old model paper white is nice reading\",\"a resistant buyer rejoice on his choice i researched the purchase of a kindly for a long time i couldn t decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e reader boy am i glad i made this purchase the downside to amazon s online selling of kindly is that the customers don t get to see it in person it is much better in person this may sound stupid but when i got my new kindly i thought there was a stuck on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit s buttons etc i actually tried to peel it off doh the e ink on this unit is that good i didn t realize that i was staring at the actual display i also didn t realize that no power is required until the display changes thus the great battery life i do a lot of reading but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight the new kindly has been a godsend now i can decide the size of type i need depending on my level of fatigue among other things the weight and economics are very good for someone like me with neuropathy in his hands it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own to me it is easier to read than print books the ease of navigation is great as is the speed the battery life so far has been extraordinary it easily connected to our home wi fi which by design does not broadcast an said it downloads books so fast that i almost thought they were not completely received i did not buy the g version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where i live if you are not constantly traveling i don t see the need to spend the extra bucks but that is a matter of personal choice for those who have no wi fi at home remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via usb read more\",\"works great and i love the built in light exactly what it is supposed to be works great and i love the built in light perfect reader and very quick delivery\",\"great i use to hate to read but now that i have my kindly and i can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better i love to read\",\"paperwhite voyage no regrets people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friends who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have ppi so the dollar jump turns out price the voyage s page press isn t always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you don t need auto light adjustment it s been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regrets the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it s not hard to change the setting either as you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery was on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about customs which i may have if i used a third party shipping service\",\"best kindly so far i bought the first kindly when it came out and while i liked it i didn t use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use the second generation kindly was a lot better but i still preferred to read physical books with the kindly being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space i still buy physical books but most are donated to the local library salvation army etc after i ve read them next about a year after it came out i bought what amazon called the kindly keyboard and was hooked i began using the kindly as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the kindly keyboard couldn t be improved upon i ve since given a couple as gifts i liked the storage capacity the g capability and thought i wouldn t want to be without the keyboard after reading more than seventy books on it i couldn t imagine trying a kindly with less memory and only wi fi i was wrong i ordered this th generation kindly earlier this year thinking i d have it for a backup to my kindly keyboard instead it has become my much preferred device storage room with the cloud it s really not an issue i keep a few reference books on both of my current singles the keyboard and this one as well as what i m currently reading i haven t had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity while it would be nice to have g it s not a deal killer at all i ve already read close to books on this kindly and i ve only found myself without easy access to wi fi once when i m close to finishing a book i plan ahead and download a new one or two so that i m ready wherever i happen to be read more\",\"honest kindly review let me guess you love books but you re not sure you want to get a kindly because you love the feel of books right m here to tell you that the kindly is the perfect balance of book and digital format short reviews you should buy a kindly get the paperwhite with no ads you re welcome long review love physical books too i m with you but i know myself and i know that once i forget to take the book i m reading with me that s it i ll start another book and rarely finish the first i also know if i try and read on my phone or ipad that i ll get distracted and start wondering about what s happening on the internet instagram s not gon na scroll itself either way i m not finishing the book why kindlethe kindly takes the best of both worlds and dashes them together the e ink display is honestly incredible i wish phones had an e ink display it really looks just like a printed page so you get the experience of reading a physical paper book but with the parks of being digital namely share what book you re reading to goodreads facebook or twitter so you can look short built in dictionary so you can learn the proper spelling of the word short export your highlights as a pdfplus it ll also sync with the kindly app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you re in the bathroom don t pretend you don t do that you re either on your phone or you re reading the freeze ingredients reading in beetle backlight looks great it s a perfect size read more\",\"know what you are buying i ve had this kindly for a while now many of the reviews say it all so i don t think i could add much but i feel like i need to speak on behalf of this kindly to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought if this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it so i have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us also you have any clue what you bought let s all say it out loud this kindly does not have a light it is an entry level model with no light amazon has always sold non lighted singles and i still have many of them they are a cheap way to get into the e reader scene can you read a real book in the dark of course not so these non lighted singles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light it is ridiculous to buy this kindly then give it a star review because it doesn t have a light read the product descriptions this kindly has no light the paperwhite and voyage do scream all to the heavens this kindly does not have page turning buttons to buy this kindly then give it a star review because your old kindly had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane could you not see when you clicked on buy that this kindly had no page turning buttons sometimes i think there are two kinds of kindly owners those who want page turning buttons and those who don t mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page if you can tell by my sarcasm i belong to the latter bunch then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is are unable to sign on and blame it on the kindly bam another star review read more\",\"ive loved both my paperwhite and voyage is the oasis worth the additional cost update after using my oasis for almost months i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed where it s lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style for my reading elsewhere for example if i want to read while eating i use my voyage w origami case to hold it upright i can read the same book using both singles since they stay synth d to one another and it s given me basically the best of both worlds at least for my style of reading the voyage with cover almost seems clunky bunker and heavier compared to the oasis but when it s sitting on a table it hardly matters i have to say that i m fortunate in being able to afford both and the new base model kindly that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non illuminated display works just fine my original review follows amazon released the first kindly in november of eight and a half years later the oasis model is the th generation kindly and the third evolution of kindly with built in illumination the price of was a bit of a shock but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april th i then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not i had made the right decision now that its finally been released and i have it in my hands how different is it and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price my kindly experience i purchased my first kindly a first generation paperwhite when it was first released in sept i purchased the voyage when it was first released in sept read more\",\"i wanted a dedicated e reader and that s what i got i m a first time kindly owner so i have nothing to compare the latest kindly to i don t own a book i don t own an ipad and in any case that s comparing apples to oranges i don t have a sony e reader this will be a short simple review i received my kindly about a week ago and haven t been able to put it down things i like about my kindly the e ink display is amazing using the way controller is simple and effective page turn speeds are faster than i thought they would be it s lightweight even with the attached cover i have an amazon cover with a built in light page turning buttons are quiet and well placed recharge time is fast i can order a book and start reading it in less than seconds nice portability i can take books with me when i travel for work and not require additional suitcase or baggage fees things i m not too keen on buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly lack of individual number buttons is frustrating power button on the bottom not a bad thing just an odd thing same for the headphones input i usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when i read things i hope change in the future how books are organized when i put a book in a collection which is actually a tag it still appears in the main list it s not actually moved it s merely associated the look of the main screen i d like folders or some other way to display collections ability to create personal screen saves e book pricing though amazon has little control over this still most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback paperback counterparts read more\",\"a new step forward for me in reading on my kindly of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i have loved and used my kindly keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark i purchased a kindly fire and i also use an ipad but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindly keyboard i wanted to get a kindly paperwhite e reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money i got this because i wanted to reduce my restrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced restrain and high clarity and contrast of the text i have added a video of the kindly paperwhite compared to a kindly keyboard and a kindly fire if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear i use the kindly because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it the kindly has brought back that reading experience and now with the cruiser text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment i laid my kindly keyboard and the new kindly paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding with better contrast lighting and custom designed fonts the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e reader before with ppi pixels per inch this screen provides a by pixel screen that just makes the old kindly keyboard look old fashioned technology certainly does move quickly on read more\",\"regulated usb power supply one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no reliable and well regulated for dual voltage v and v without too much heat generation in europe asia\",\"love love love so happy i don t know why there are so many bad reviews first of let s start off by pointing out the obvious it s under you re not going to receive a kindly paperwhite before you order read the specs and compare it to the other singles yes the specs say it doesn t have backlighting so honestly there shouldn t be one ounce of surprise when you receive this i on the other hand love this little kindly i have had the new kindly paperwhite and i really didn t like how big it was to hold in my small hands i don t have children hands but i m a female and my hands are on the small side maybe for a male this would be kind of small id anyway it is smaller than the paperwhite but i love that i also love the fact that it doesn t come with a light i used to read at night with the paperwhite but that light gave me a headache so i stopped it is not as dark as these bad reviews make it seem you can read perfectly fine being indoors they re exaggeration this feels more like a book to me than the kindly paperwhite ever did the letters on this kindly are amazing i don t even notice the difference between ppi and i love that the letters are way darker than the paperwhite the paperwhite had a grey hue to them and i didn t feel like i was reading a book i felt like i actually holding a technical device to read a book of course since this doesn t have a backlight you can not read in the dark it s common sense if you want to read at night purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindly it s not a big deal and you re not going to break the bank buying a item when you can buy this little awesome e book reader for think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e books read more\",\"i wanted a dedicated e reader and that s what i got i m a first time kindly owner so i have nothing to compare the latest

control over this read more\",\"good value at with a few its i am writing this from the perspective of being a long time experienced kindly user vs someone brand new from an overall perspective considering the pricing of the kindly with special offers at vs higher amounts for the different flavors of kindly available today this one is a bargain if you have wanted to get your kids a kindly to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because to is a lot of money to risk with a child maybe at this is your price point from a size standpoint the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e ink singles it is slightly thicker but slightly lighter than the kindly paperwhite but to me it s not really a noticeable difference when you re holding it in a protective cover opening up the box included with the kindly is a micro usb cord but no power adapter that s really annoying interesting and it seems rather chicken of amazon a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the kindly or if you purchase it later so if you already have a micro usb charger handy i wouldn t order one of the chargers there are no page buttons no buttons at all except for the power button and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you re reading or wiping the screen with your finger reading is easy on this one in comparison to my kindly keyboard the previous version of kindly and a kindly dx the letters on the screen are much much darker and easier to read the display is crisp and dark read more\",\"love the new kindly love the new kindly priced right with an extra off even smaller in my hands than the kindly with keyboard i was sad to lose my old kindly but this one is just terrific\",\"five stars meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the oasis e reader\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved read more\",\"do you just want to read a book than this is the kindly for you people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i have owned a kindly for several years now i have had the nd generation kindly and i have had the kindly keyboard when my mom expressed interest in getting a kindly i decided to give her my kindly keyboard because she doesnt have wifi in her house and my older kindly keyboard had g which is what she needed and i decided to buy the basic kindly for myself because i didnt want to wait for the paperwhite to come out and i just needed wifi and and most importantly i just want to read a book not listen to text to speech or go shopping on amazon or listen to music etc all i want to do is read a book thats it this kindly is perfect for that its smaller and lighter the pages turn faster than the keyboard version it basically has everything i need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the paperwhite or keyboard yes you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindly with a way controller but i rarely use the keyboard anyway to download a book i just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my kindly which is much quicker no matter what version of kindly you have so if you dont need want or use all the extras then i would definitely recommend the basic kindly for with special offers because who really pays attention to the screen saves anyway\",\"great device for reading people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no my previous kindly was a dx this is my second kindly in years love the form factor and all but i do miss the physical buttons for page turning there is a glitch in the software though i use the english interface but occasionally i would like to translate words into traditional chinese however it seems that the traditional chinese characters can not display correctly and become small boxes the simplified chinese characters can be displayed correctly though\",\"easy to read and very light but was frustrated with a few things this is my th kindly since i bought my first one as soon as kindly was launched with every new model i was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends the voyager was the first time i felt somewhat frustrated with an amazon product yes it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models if you are buying your first one don t hesitate it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an ipad even if it is an ipad mini but there are a few things that i thing amazon should fix on this one specially because it is the top of the line kindly the battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself the magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader previous covers just stayed in place and even the apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one as you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen the way i got used to handle the kindly and as i constantly change hands when i am reading i get a lot of desired page turns because i touched the screen somewhere a very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device battery life even with the cover is far from what i expected my old kindly had a battery that lasted for more than a month the new one needs charging every days the device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag read more\",\"five stars great product and really protects the tablet\",\"a great product that s now even better if

people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m a first time kindly owner so i have nothing to compare the latest kindly to i don t own a book i don t own an ipad and in any case that s comparing apples to oranges i don t have a sony e reader this will be a short simple review i received my kindly about a week ago and haven t been able to put it down things i like about my kindly the e ink display is amazing using the way controller is simple and effective page turn speeds are faster than i thought they would be it s lightweight even with the attached cover i have an amazon cover with a built in light page turning buttons are quiet and well placed recharge time is fast i can order a book and start reading it in less than seconds nice portability i can take books with me when i travel for work and not require additional suitcase or baggage fees things i m not too keen on buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly lack of individual number buttons is frustrating power button on the bottom not a bad thing just an odd thing same for the headphones input i usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when i read things i hope change in the future how books are organized when i put a book in a collection which is actually a tag it still appears in the main list it s not actually moved it s merely associated the look of the main screen i d like folders or some other way to display collections ability to create personal screen saves e book pricing though amazon has little control over this still most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback paperback counterparts read more\",\"ive loved both my paperwhite and voyage is the oasis worth the additional cost note my original kindly oasis review was posted on on this product page on amazon new kindly oasis e reader with leather charging cover this page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the u s my original review follows update after using my oasis for almost months i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed where it s lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style for my reading elsewhere for example if i want to read while eating i use my voyage w origami case to hold it upright i can read the same book using both singles since they stay synth d to one another and it s given me basically the best of both worlds at least for my style of reading the voyage with cover almost seems clunky bunker and heavier compared to the oasis but when it s sitting on a table it hardly matters i have to say that i m fortunate in being able to afford both and the new base model kindly that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non illuminated display works just fine my original review follows amazon released the first kindly in november of eight and a half years later the oasis model is the th generation kindly and the third evolution of kindly with built in illumination the price of was a bit of a shock but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april th read more\",\"five stars i am happy in having this good things\",\"perfect for academics i was so shocked so i was going through a book for my phd dissertation highlighting parts for further citations in my project when i was done with it i realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e book looking for the highlights i can just export them to my e mail in pdf file this is life changing for me i have always preferred paper books to e books but this option is a miracle it saved me hours of work i am a very happy customer\",\"superb reading device but which one s best for you this is a review of the kindly paperwhite launched july essentially the same as the previous kindly paperwhite but with a fantastic upgraded dpi screen more memory and storage it s a terrific reading device this review aims to describe both this product and compare it with the other kindly devices available to help you choose the best one for you before i start ive noticed several complains about kindly not supporting the pub format used by canadian public libraries dont be put off theres a solution in the frequently asked questions section below this review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits if youre in a hurry ive included a summary at the start and a frequently asked questions section at the end summary what can you do with it read a book it can store s of books take an entire library away with you on holiday buy a book you can browse the amazon kindly store and buy books over a wifi connection borrow a book using the kindly owners library you can borrow one of books if you have amazon prime membership share your books using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family highlight a section using the touch screen you can highlight a particular interesting few lines if several people highlight the same section that s also indicated record a bookmark to come back to it later read a book on your kindly continue on your smartphone or tablet computer and it will jump to your last known position look up a word and record them in the vocabulary builder track a characters appearance throughout a book using the x ray feature read for weeks without needing to recharge typically weeks share you books multiple singles on the same account or family sharing access every book you ve ever owned on the cloud available for download within seconds over wifi or g what devices are available as of july amazon have the following kindly devices on sale kindly around cdn kindly paperwhite th generation dpi launched october around cdn new kindly paperwhite th gen dpi launched july around cdn kindly voyager around us doesnt seem to be on sale in amazon canada kindly fire or colour tablet computers at around cdn so you re faced with a few devices plus additional options which to buy here s a quick summary in order of cost the entry level kindly an entry level black and white e ink book reader it has a inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books and a battery which should last around weeks a terrific device to read books and a worthy contender for the technically minded it has a gh processor and gb of memory with an e ink display essentially this means it s a black and white b fantastic to read even in bright sunlight c requires very little power hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours new kindly paperwhite launched in this is really an upgrade adding a super sharp display with pixels per inch the same as the top of the range voyage the high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye but battery life is reduced from weeks of the original paperwhite to weeks but still a very long time compared to the existing paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and sticker than before and a new booker font plus better presentation of fonts on screen if you have an existing paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading however if you own a prior device you notice the huge leap in screen quality contrast and performance the voyage far more expensive that paperwhite this is thinner and g lighter it has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e reader body which makes it look more like a tablet and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges the back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand and it has new page press buttons on the side to turn the pages when the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback nice touch it has gb of storage same as the paperwhite and a similar battery which should last around weeks on a single charge although it has the same sharp dpi screen as the paperwhite the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions this means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright in addition you find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness to compensate the voyage automatically soften the light slightly a lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device kindly fire tablet computer the kindly fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the kindly range similar to the apple ipad mini it has a high resolution screen a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life hours rather than weeks although you can read books on a fire using the amazon kindly app you find the kindly with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book you find it produces less eye strain and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web watching videos and reading emails the kindly is a dedicated book reader device unlike a kindly the fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep the paperwhite and voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back light which is far more suited to reading in bed and it wont for example wake your partner if reading in the dark finally unlike the rest of the kindly range the fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use its less useful on holiday the kindly range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight what other options do i have having decided upon the model kindly paperwhite voyage or fire the next decision is around special offers ie adverts g or wifi connectionpersonally i have no issue with adverts on a kindly they only appear on screen when the screen save is on and are not at all distracting the g option is a more difficult question this effectively means you can use your kindly to buy or download books over the air instead of at home or near a wifi hotspot personally i went for the wifi model as the saving is considerable but its a personal choice of course if you wont have wifi at home then you need the g option one point worth mentioning however is if you have a modern smartphone you can always create a personal hotspot or local wifi signal that your kindly or indeed any other wifi device can connect to got to settings personal hotspot on your mobile to set one up and you can connect your wifi only kindly while youre out and about conclusion if you love books but your on a budget the original kindly with wifi and special offers is a great option you still be able to carry thousands of book around with you but you lose out on the soft white back light and super crisp display of the papwerwhite the kindly paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb dpi super sharp screen finally theres the top of the range voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness if youre in the market for a tablet computer then the kindly fire range is worth considering but you get a better book reading experience on the kindly myself i have both a paperwhite and an ipad air i was skeptical at first but the kindly is a perfect device for reading with one hand on the train and the back light and long battery life a huge bonus frequently asked questions q what file format will a kindly read kindly format aw kindly aw txt pdf unprotected mob prc natively in addition to html doc doc jpeg gif png amp through conversion what it doesnt support pub format no but you can convert your pub books using a freely available program called calibre simple search for you tube um tear zw and you see a video explaining how to do this simple q if i lose my kindly do i lose my books as well no all books are available on your amazon account to download on a new device q can i save my place in the book yes it will automatically save your place and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position q i often need reading glasses can i adjust the font size yes theres a range of fonts and sizes to suit all tastes can i share books with my partner or children yes you can now share your books using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family can i use a kindly to read in beta yes but only on the paperwhite and voyage models its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light for the base kindly model you need the light on are there any free books available yes over classic titles are available for free out of copyright and they can be legally downloaded if you have a amazon prime membership you can also borrow a book from the kindly owners library which includes around books q how long does the battery last depending upon model you should get between and weeks between charges on around minutes of reading per day ive certainly found ive gone for weeks without charging the device how long does it take to charge from absolutely flat around hours how many books will the kindly hold literally thousands you can also download every book youve ever owned from your amazon account so the list is quite literally unlimited q do i need anything else you need a smartphone charger or laptop with a usb socket as the kindly range doesnt come with a charger but the fire does amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it some people also buy a cover but i think this is not really needed it adds to the weight and is not really needed it will protect your kindly from a drop however and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag\",\"only lasts for less than year this is the third power charger that i have had to buy at cost of over each since my kindly fire purchase why can t the chargers last a reasonable amount of time when i connected this charger i received a message saying that it was a low level charger it probably would not charge while the kindly was in use not acceptable for this cost\",\"fantastic device pick your kindly having been a little overwhelmed by the choices between all the new singles and which one to get i ordered this new basic kindly first to take for a spin so far i like what i see i also own a kindly so that s the only device i can really compare it to at this time i think a comparison between other tablets and this kindly is meaningless this device is all about content and delivery form factor compared to the kindly this kindly feels more compact lighter and easier to hold my hands wrap around this better than k reading books for a few hours at a stretch will be easier on this device compared to the k it is the lightest such device i have used compared to all previous singles and other tablets screen i personally like the fact that there are no keys on the device and that keys come up on the screen when you need them delivers a better overall reading experience however navigating through the on screen keyboard with the way controller can be taxing if you need to do a lot of searching and you might miss the full physical keyboard i hardly search on the kindly itself i search for books on my laptop so this is a non issue price at you can t go wrong compared to buying paperback or hardcover editions you will recover the cost of this in a matter of a few months because most kindly content is priced cheaper than print editions and you get it instantly and can access it wherever you are not to mention all the free kindly downloads available in the catalog display almost the same e ink display at the k no glare no reflection you can sit in bright sunlight and read it just like a book page turns seem a lot faster on this compared to the k read more\",\"i had a kindly before found it very easy to find what i needed to do only stars because i found it very confusing at first i had a kindly before found it very easy to find what i needed to do the user guide didn t really answer my

for streaming we live in an rv and we get internet through our phones hotspot or from free wifi in rv parks fire tv is sometimes the only way to pick up the tv shows we have missed i have not been able to find cbn or the blaze tv on the device those and two of my favorites that i used to watch on the roku device that i miss\",\"i love the fire tv it is just fantastic i love the fire tv it is just fantastic i am now now watching my ultraviolet collection with flixster app from fire tv and plays absolutely fantastic\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips and hbo go i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes read more\",\"nifty little device this is a great device if you don t have a smart tv apparently mine streams amazon prime but the interface is so terrible that i never bothered using it or other streaming device besides the chromecast which is very limited first of all little things the packaging was very nice the remote itself feels amazing to hold and the buttons are very simple the fire tv itself is beautiful very minimalist all you see is the tiny led on the front when it s in use the voice search is great it didn t catch ilina mental but it could be because i searched her name right after searching john travolta it brought up musicals will ferret etc without a problem voice search only works within everything available on prime it seems things available to rent or stream and i wish it included the netflix titles perhaps with a see on netflix button instead of just showing me the rent option for what isn t on instant prime i wish you could sort by amazon prime only movies with an interface similar to netflix s i want to see what s available to me now not what i can rent the games are fun and it s pretty cool to be able to play phone games on the tv my whole family actually enjoyed playing minions rush i don t have any controllers yet and i hope that p games if they aren t out yet are coming in the future i ve only had mine a day but so far i m loving this purchase we do have an xbox one smart tv and even a computer hooked up downstairs into the same monitor but the bone interface for netflix is so awful that we hardly ever use it unlike the one on the and it s a pain just to have to start up the computer and interact with such a huge screen with computer peripherals because our video smart is rather clunky and slow it has never loaded any video streaming for us before somehow crashing this fire tv clears those problems and with an incredibly simple interface love it i would give this stars if you could use the voice search for commands and inside apps such as netflix edit april after using my fire tv for about a week i ve settled into what i use it for most until i get my gaming controller which is apparently on rankorder until the rd i mostly wanted a device to watch my favorite shows via netflix or locally without any troubles it s much faster to launch and use the netflix app on the fire tv than it is on my smart tv the xbox one and the computer hooked up to it via hdi it s also perfect for streaming locally via alex my music tv shows movies and more are so very easily accessible on here vs the computer hooked up which is not my pc and the xbox one which is such a nightmare for this task that i barely consider it this app is only cents and will make your fire tv experience a lot more enjoyable so you really owe it to yourself to get it i absolutely love the feel of the remote and how simple and intuitive it is to use after finding with the tv remote for the input button which despite always being in the same spot i always have trouble finding it s a joy to use a remote that is much simpler this probably makes me sound old i m the remote orientation doesn t matter so you don t fiddle around with making sure you ve pointed it correctly i suppose this is because it uses bt the voice search which i use somewhat often is a joy to use it s much better than shouting across the room at the direct which only picks up what i say less than half of the time i hope microsoft doesn t save voice recordings the same way amazon does because about of that is just me yelling profanities at the direct\",\"it s good but i like the device i had the apple tv the amazon is better than apple and roku the only network amazon needs is the wwe network app there is a lot of wwe fans out there with amazon that would love this app\",\"great way to watch movies this little piece of equipment is a great way to watch movies and tv series it s so simple to use\",\"excellent device this is a device that works as advertised it is simple and quick to set up but requires a call to the internet provider in order to obtain the necessary password since i never watch any network tv except fox having movies available at all times is very satisfying\",\"example is difficult to find you tube i am in south america and here dozen t work like apple apple tv is very easy you see everything in one page the amazon fire tv control is very nice\",\"amazon fire tv amazon fire tv is a must to have especially if you are paying the high prices of cable tv on demand etc i have cancelled those options am enjoying most of those same features on amazon fire tv movies tv

happy customer o\",\"very capable set top box i got mine the day after it was unveiled out of the box it required an update it s the fastest ui of any other box that i have currently there aren t as many apps as i would like to see but i imagine they ll be coming soon i am not able to get my kindly fire dx to mirror the display yet it won t connect for some reason including more apps coming soon apparently the amazon music app will be available soon as well games are very cool i don t have the separate controller but have had fun with the games you can play with the remote these aren t mediocre games you would find on the roku but high quality mobile games of course the games aren t full on xbox or ps style but beautifully scaled mobile games you d play on your smartphone or tablet if you get your entertainment from the amazon ecosystem this is an excellent device\",\"i like it amazon but this is important of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no an amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysjuly hi dallas thank you for sharing your feedback we wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite prime content with the click of your remote you can now browse many more prime only categories including top prime tv top prime movies prime tv for kids prime movies for kids prime tv by genre and prime movies by genre\",\"a good initial release but fails on the promise as background i own several apple tvs roku s and chromecasts along with plenty of other devices i also have a large investment in bluray and dvd having had over films during my peak of building out a home theater with that comes a substantial uv vfd flixster and digital copy library itunes initial usage of the fire tv has shown me that this box is fast and flexible the voice search is excellent but for some reason the search only picks up amazon content it does not currently show available media on flixster or netflix this is for something that was touted as an open ecosystem and not a proprietary one well then how do i access my existing libraryworse but along with the previous point easily fixable is the fact that my only access to my uv library is through flixster flixster works great on a tablet but for some reason the fire tv is not properly caching the content of my movies so overtime i launch the app it takes minutes to show the content further all recent films are not available in hd this is a huge hole in the openness and functionality of the fire tv i can t search on my content i can t watch much of my content in hd easy fixes but a hard sale for someone who owns a roku or apple tv fire tv needs vfd as an app and access to the itunes library that folks own to be truly open i m vested in uv and amazon should take note of that as folks like me are typically the leading edge uv has matured and amazon needs to be a much better partner update i talked to amazon com and they confirmed that netflix chose to not enable the search functionality thus the fire tv search does not bring up netflix content the same appears true for flixster and they confirmed that fire tv is not currently a supported hd devices for flixster content all fixable but ultimately making the fire tv currently a closed eco systems with no real access to uv or other parties digital content that customers may already own it s a tough pill to call up a search for content you own and only be presented with purchase options from amazon\",\"outdated netflix i like it but the most used app is netflix this netflix app version is older and a pain to use why they have this outdated one doesn t make any sense\",\"so glad i gave this a try wasn t sure how this would work with my rural del but it is wonderful i haven t had any problems with it at all it is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would so very very glad i bought it loads of stuff to watch i have been able to catch up with some series i have missed especially the bbc ones that i dearly love i recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch along with my amazon prime most everything is free that is an added bonus try it you ll like it\",\"finally the right streaming device this is a wonderful streaming device i have been an apple tv man since but i have decided that i just might never return to my apple tv i have used owned all generations and have known them inside and out unlocked my st generation for secret stuff shah and swore by them for years i just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch voice command is a nice touch but i was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor no more waiting for my videos to buffer and this is especially important in my house where my wife kids and i are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos final word if you re just looking for a great device to stream both netflix and amazon prime then you ve found the right streamer\",\"better than apple tv roku i have had apple tv and roku for over a year and i can say without reservation that the amazon fire tv is far better for two reasons the program movie i want to watch starts immediately with a single click unlike roku and apple tv which can take forever at times after several clicks voice search having to type search can be cumbersome and a nuisance unless i want to watch one of the itunes movies i own on the apple tv i always use the fire it s simply better\",\"i like it amazon but this is important people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no an amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysjuly hi dallas thank you for sharing your feedback we wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite prime content with the click of your remote you can now browse many more prime only categories including top prime tv top prime movies prime tv for kids prime movies for kids prime tv by genre and prime movies by genre\",\"amazing cosmic powers witty witty box first is basically just what it sounds like it turns your tv into a giant kindly fire if you are familiar with other streaming media players you have an idea of what to expect first streams video and audio content to your tv from the same providers hulu netflix and of course amazon so lets go through my first experience part one opening the box queue thus space zarathustra ok i have to say it nothing impressive here sorry amazon i have to say that the first is about the most boring looking black box ive ever seen the good news it completely disappears on your entertainment center the remote is pretty bare bones looking the microphone button grabbed my attention but otherwise there are very few buttons can i complain that it is both very black and very small yes i know that black is the new black but ive already lost it once and ive had it for about hours ok enough look look time to um hook puppy part two setup where is my that was easy button power checkhdmi cable checkturn on tv checkwait for it to bootwaitits done check that was fast and done check im an amazon prime member and my account was already setup on the box and ready to go part three interface what does this button do actually its not rocket science the home button takes you back to the home screen click the wheel to scroll through options hit the button to make your selection voice search ok i will tell you i am not a big user of voice tech really i hate to use the telephone i guess im afraid the pizza guy is going to tell me no but i can see that with a little getting over my own fears voice search is going to be awesome my first correctly heard all three of my queries one caveat here voice search only pulls up amazon content no a huge deal for my family but maybe for yours you can always search the old fashioned way like other streaming boxes part four video and audio i said it was easy to hook up just plug it in video looked great on my tv audio was good over our home stereo the quality did not seem any better or worse than my other hd set top box the services available to stream from are also pretty standard fare both on the video and audio front part five games thousands of games coming this reminds me a bit of the days when i got the original kindly fire of course amazon made good on their promise there so i have faith that they do the same here just a quick view through the list of already available games tells me that there is already a good mix of approved titles for the fire tv and more are on the horizon please do not mistake this for a nextgen gaming console it looks like a good choice to be able to play tons of android games on your big screen overall stars fire tv is a very nice mix of old and new there are a few puzzle pieces missing but knowing amazon they be filled in quickly\",\"so far we are very happy especially kids as they have all their favorite cancelled att u verse and bought this w netflix and amazon prime so far we are very happy especially kids as they have all their favorite shows movies\",\"issues setting up basic apps audio problems very centered around amazon vod it was time for me to upgrade my roku xs and after looking at the roku and the amazon fire tv i decided to go with the fire tv i don t use a lot of the private channels on roku and the only thing i saw missing that i have on roku is spotify and i ll work around that the main reason i decide to go for the fire tv over the roku was the gaming feature i m not a heavy gamer but having a device that allowed me to play games with a real game pad for only sounded appealing i ll break my review into sections so others can quick reference it i ll say now this got stars because it is fast and because if you don t mind getting amazon vod stuffed down your throat there is some good content setupinitial boot up was easy plug in and go and it autoplays a simple intro video however i immediately had issues setting up both alex and netflix netflix still will not work i get what looks like computer code with the message error forwarding request to origin on alex and hulu there is a high pitched metallic echo with all audio and on hulu i occasionally get a pink lavender screen with audio but no video some internet searching suggested this had to do with a handshake issue and that reporting should fix it it didn t however when i plugged my old roku back in it worked fine navigation and search text and voice the fire tv is very very very amazon vod centered most of your navigation data from the main menu pushes you to amazon movies tv or apps games all other channels reside under the apps column as far as i can tell the voice search only searches amazon content this really bothers me as none of the videos web ads write ups etc mentions this they bag how they have all your favorite content from hulu netflix tackle alex but fail to mention that you can not search those other apps channels big turn off for me once inside the other channels navigating and searching works just like the roku clicking around with the little remote the more i think about it the more it annoys me because amazon advertising made such a big deal out of the voice search and how no one liked clicking around with the remote watching tv moviesdon t know my audio was too awful to watch anything never made it to a single show i tried changing the settings but that didn t do any good every program has a high pitched echo on it however it doesn t have the audio issues when playing games so no idea what the issue is playing gamestbd i ve played a couple games of asphalt with the remote and it was pretty cool but a race car game on a remote is a bit tedious they show out of stock on the amazon game controller and it looks like they pulled the nyqo due to poor performance i d like to get the controller and see what it s like if the games are still decent i might swap out the unit and see if that fixes my sound video issues overall impression do not like the amazon fire tv and i m displeased with amazon for it i ve always trusted amazon as a company and they ve always taken care of me before but i feel like they pushed a lot of smoke and mirrors to sell this device i m torn between trying to get it to work and just returning it and getting a roku\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips and hbo go i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking br br first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content br br the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review br br i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there br br wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly br br chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices read more\",\"amazon fire tv received my amazon fire tv weeks ago it works good very responsive with quad core but the interface seems very limited on apps the main ones are there amazon of course net fix and a must have alex but missing a lot of others still like roku as a main streaming unit a little slower but checked full of apps amazon needs to get with it if they are going to lead the pack here also the speech search is not usable with net fix or any of the other apps only works with amazon this is definitely loaded heavy on the amazon side it makes no sense to have a great feature that cant work with the whole package i would recommend to others but tell them of the draw backs so they know what they are getting in to here great product but needs some one to help it along\",\"omg ok i m not going to lie this thing as the fastest setup i thought i was seeing things when i turned it on for the first time apparently this device is connected to your amazon prime account so once you turn it on it automatically literally goes straight to your prime account without signing in i seriously had to call customer service because i was really created out on if i signed in or not anyway this thing is way better than the roku though i do wish they had a iphone app for it because the remote is so small and i tend to lose it alot its pretty much the same format on the roku when it comes to netflix and hulu it goes to the next episode atomically like samsung smart tv and the roku but i guess its a common thing but amazon prime you have to select the next episode itself i seem to see this in a lot of other streaming devices\",\"superior amazon customer service support was the deciding factor for me here goes i m the thousands reviewer for this product lol short preface i love amazon so when comparing all streaming devices in the end i went with the fire tv because of the outstanding customer service and it will improve with time that being said i share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have i hate not being able to sort out the non prime videos i truly dislike paying for an episode i didn t see that one coming even though i did a ton of research but overall i love my new cable bill which only includes internet and basic and i mean basic service because i m preserving the right to order hbo and showtime at some point was massively disappointed in hulu plus because they don t offer the entire series in a show anymore did they run out of server space or what netflix was a pleasant surprise in case you are wondering netflix hulu plus and prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill and streaming is quite alright after you get over the initial shock of not having live tv although abc does do live tv hope the other stations follow suit soon overall as a non tech person it was ridiculously easy to hook this up really anyone can do it and like i said if you re comparing other products in the end amazon can not be beat for customer service or support\",\"awesome i recently received my amazon fire tv after months of researching which streaming device would be the best basically what you are paying for is the internal specs which amazon has every other device beat by far the software limitations i am confident will be resolved soon like logo and amazon mp apps being added we got this device to replace cable dish with subscriptions to netflix dvds amazon prime and hulu plus there is very little we are missing by streaming and much we are saving the folks complaining about hulu stopping in the middle of programming i have had this happen here and there but it has been at peak internet use times only during the day when folks are at work i have had problems streaming just make sure you have good high speed internet and a cable modem router that can fully support the number of devices being used at one time i am totally happy with our purchase of the amazon first\",\"excellent love it my amazon prime movies come in crystal clear and fast the voice search really works very well netflix resolution is excellent much better than what the netflix app on my lg flatscreen tv delivers the alex app delivers excellent video i haven t tried the music yet having used this for a little over a week now my next step is to buy two more for each tv in the house and give away my apple tv it simply does everything so much better most satisfied highly recommend will post an update if i have anything further to add but i will say this go get one really worth the price\",\"not that great having bought of the roku and i am a little spoiled the fire has very few or limited outdated apps mostly amazon apps no hbo go no pbs no targetticket showtime anytime is out of date does not list direct as provider no vfd it does have flixster but it loads very slow the usb port is useless why is even there what a let down sending mine back not worth\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content i hope that s the case or i will really be disappointed update the latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for amazon prime members addressing most of my original complaints now that there is an entire section dedicated to prime content it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content i wouldn t mind seeing more categories to search through but don t want to diminish the improvement it s still not possible to search and return only prime content i think it should be possible to tell the device when you search that you only want returns from what is available for free to prime members the new music option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point not sure why it was added but i hope it grows into a useful feature given the new prime music package i would also like to see some sort of dna feature added as one who rips all content that i buy blu rays dvds cds to a computer on my network i would very much like to be able to stream this material to the first adding support for a connected usb device is not a solution for me i have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material read more\",\"i like it amazon but this is important it seems to work fine so far days with it what i don t like is how amazon has made it so theprime content is mixed with the for pay content with no easy way to just see what is only prime content this is obviously made to divert you into buying more non prime content amazon please give us a clear way to view prime only if that s what we want i know we can voice search for anything and that s great but sometimes we just want to go fishing and would like to fish in the prime pond only this is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing think roku products that let you do just that hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do maybe an update in the near future will fix this\",\"wow buy this immediately i received my fire tv today i am surprised amazed thrilled and extremely pleased it s all that and a bag of chips the ease of use is so simple lookup is a breeze i had it hooked up and running with in minutes the remote is small so what my only con is the voice search should be for everything to own this and not have amazon prime should be a crime lol it s a must for the fire tv i gave up direct tv in january i was paying to much for what i was getting with the fire tv it s customized tv at your finger tips no more paying for channels you don t need and no more cable bill i hope more people are waking up and pitching pay tv i pay for netflix i watch tackle for free no more commercials no more unwanted un needed channels movies when i want sit coms when i want no more running to pick up a dvd i m telling ya streaming is where it s at and this device is a must life is hard this is easy\",\"improvements there are many things i like about amazon fire tv but i get tired of having to reset it a lot of times i have to plug and plug it in after every use with netflix for some reason the screen turns white the second time i use the app would be great if you could fix this issue considering it took me an hour to get it initially started because of an update which makes no sense for a new product it has worked so so it freezes up when streaming videos on hulu a good bit i would like to have the option to remove shows from your watch list especially when i view a show for the first time and don t like it sometimes the shows will start and then go right back to the homepage this should not be happening without a button being depressed i guess everything new has bugs but my question would be when is amazon going to update the product and fix some of these bugs\",\"a couple of downside i bought this to supplement my other streaming devices i already have a sony google tv which supports the amazon prime streaming and youtube etc it connects to my tv using the hdi and i have an android tablet that lets me connect through the hdi to my tv the reason i bought the fire tv was i was under the impression i could use it to download apps which is sort of true and the app i wanted to use was the finite tv go i have it on my android tablet but since it s wi fi only it suffers a lot from shutters and stops etc so i figured since the fire tv connects to my cat lan i would have a faster connection first grape when i get the fire first thing i tried to find was the finite app it wasn t on the fire s menu at all then i got on amazon s site and found it on amazon s app store but there s a great big red x next to the app saying it s not compatible d r a second grape no matter what i ve tried to do i can not figure out how to limit my browsing of movies and tv shows to only show prime eligible content on my sony google tv the app that came with it lets me filter out the content so that only my prime membership free streaming shows up in my search results imho this a less than subtle method of forcing you to make a buying decision every time you look for content i don t know which is worse no filters or embedded advertising third grape the app store is extremely limited there s just a little over apps available considering this is an android device and the android play store probably has well over apps that s very poor app support oh yes either i couldn t find it or there is no web browser it seems that everyone that makes one of these devices has their own little world that they support and they try to block out every one else that could be competition the end result is the consumer ends up paying the penalty amazon needs to wake up not everyone is in love with amazon yes for a first timer the fire is a reasonably slick device to own but i simply can t see the point in keeping the fire it s so extremely limited as compared to a real android device and everything it does is already duplicated on one of my other devices i am sending it back for a refund\",\"pleased with the purchase i really enjoy the amazon fire tv i only have trouble locating all of the amazon prime movies and tv shows in one grouping i wish i could stream only the movies and tv shows that is included with my prime membership otherwise this device works excellent the install was a breeze glad i purchased it\",\"i like it amazon but this is important amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysjuly hi dallas thank you for sharing your feedback we wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite prime content with the click of your remote you can now browse many more prime only categories including top prime tv top prime movies prime tv for kids prime movies for kids prime tv by genre and prime movies by genre\",\"excellent streaming right out of the box i have used the fire tv for a day and i think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality my brief review follows but first i d like to comment on some of the negative reviews i ve seen for the product many of them are from people who haven t purchased the product others grape about what the product doesn t have even though they product clearly states that it doesn t have it for example there is a lot of grossing about no logo whether that comes to the first or not it isn t available right now a one star review because one app is missing or you can t stream some content from your hard drive even though there are apparently apps that will perform this task for the fire tv well take those types of reviews for what they might be worth let me start by saying that i own two roku s i ve owned roku s for quite some time i don t own the roku so my comparisons are probably stale the roku is a great product and you can t go wrong owning one but let me describe the features of the first that have so far delighted me easy connection to my wifi connection i have never been able to connect to my g network where my tv is located with my roku the fire tv picked up the signal easily and streaming is seamless it could be the dual antennas whatever the reason if signal capture is an issue for you the fire tv seems to work well loading of videos is very fast almost instantaneous i select a video press the remote to play and within seconds the video is streaming with no suffering issues it s very impressive set up was a breeze edit i have read that some people had an issue with the initial update that the fire tv requires mine updated with no problems i was able to connect to my wifi and my update downloaded and installed automatically voice search is very well done it took me a couple of attempts to learn to search after pressing the button and then hearing the been to talk once i figured that out i was searching for movies and tv shows easily the search results have been accurate this is a huge time save and a great convenience only amazon content is selected during the search process i understand that the other content providers have to permit search into their applications for it to work i have not figured out how to fling my fire dx screen to my tv yet once i figure this out it will open up all kinds of other options for the fire tv i didn t buy the product for this feature but i m interested to get it working this could be a huge game changer as you can access content at other sites on the web and display it on your tv i hope amazon provides more help to accomplish this i purchased the gaming controller and was able to pair it with the fire tv i haven t played anything yet but i m intrigued by the options one disappointment i have to mention where is amazon music my music collection should be available front and center there s an app for my phone there is an amazon music player app for roku so amazon should integrate the music collection it makes sense that they would do so in order to bring even more value to the entire amazon content platform i m thinking that there will be something shortly as the rumor is that amazon is going to provide a music streaming service in the very near future amazon needs to address this promptly overall if graded as just a simple streaming box it gets a with the other options the fire tv may provide miracast screen duplication games etc the product certainly exceeds my expectations updated i ve had the fire tv for two days now i was so pleased i purchased another and they have now replaced my roku xd s both of mine set up in no time and had no issues connecting quickly to my wifi network and installing the initial download i don t have a over technical set up for my wifi i have a comcast cable modem rd gen and a netgear router my fire s saw the router with ease and connected the g band this is something only one of my roku s could do because of the distance that one of them was from the router the video quality is superb i don t have these boxes set up to take advantage of dolly just simple tv speakers but the sound is forceful and clear i ve not had any issues of whining or other distortion that some have mentioned the voice search is frankly amazing i have read that some people don t like it or feel it is too limited but for searching your amazon options it is outstanding for me it is fast and accurate and is a huge time save i am eagerly awaiting adoption of the technology by other app vendors the screen layout does take some time getting used to i won t call it clunky but it is crowded it lists items in a fairly rigid order depending upon the category you are in and yes amazon content comes first that to be expected but amazon doesn t block your access to other apps if you want hulu or netflix you can get to them easily you can even use voice search to find the app you want i suspect there will be some streamlining of the interface at some point the interface does tie into the interfaces on fire dx somewhat so i can see the attempt at consistency here gaming so far has been limited but i ve found a great pinball app and am reviving my younger days on the tables the gaming controller works well and i don t have any lag playing the game i haven t attempted any others yet but i look forward to a good driving game i m a casual gamer not hard core and this system may just fit the bill my xbox glory days are over as my kids thoroughly thrash me at call of duty all in all this box delivers exactly what i wanted and more\",\"apps it will not store my netflix sign in so i need to sign in every time i do not like it\",\"amazing unit easy to set up just remember to amazing unit easy to set up just remember to also purchases an hdi to hdi cord that does not come with the amazon fire tv or you will have to wait to get started this makes my tv look more crisp and clear than it ever has

anything from google chromecast to link boxes box boxes tv etc this amazon fire tv has been my go to device since it arrived the menu could use some work but it s most likely because i m used to apple tv and my ios environment the responsiveness is top notch my favorite feature is the voice control built right into the remote i would only ask for one additional feature the ability to plug headphones into the remote and listen silently\",\"no way to search or browse prime movies only fail i was really looking forward to using what was hoped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment but the actual experience falls short pros user interface and underlying hardware is fast form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek plays games fairly well especially for such a small box quality of amazon videos is very good voice search works quite well the device came pre configured for my amazon account i just plugged it in updated the software and away i mentions first and foremost there is still no way to search for only free movies on prime amazon touts it s prime movies available but good luck finding them there is no categorization by genre you are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies or using the search function which almost never returns any prime movies voice search works only on amazon content you can not use this to search within netflix for example the amazon first box only comes with gb of memory for game and app storage which is completely inadequate there are games available for download that consume almost gb for one game good luck downloading a gb game like the racing game featured in the list of top games clearly amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content in the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device it even offers you a day prime membership for free to try it out however amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content it s clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free prime content only this is my biggest beef with amazon by far i want a netflix like experience where my prime content is sorted by genre and i can search for free movies only now if you want to pay for video rentals by all means buy this device because it works really well if you want it to access your prime content only stick to the roku box you probably already have because it works just as good update i called customer service and talked to a guy about how i can search for and access my prime movies well you can t according to him i can only find the prime movies on the two lists on first that say recently added to prime and top prime movies those lists are items and items respectively there is no way to search or browse free prime content only the guy i talked to said this was a very common request for people of course it is i don t want to pay for video rentals if i just paid for a prime membership to access free content amazon completely failed i am returning the fire tv\",\"nd best purchase from amazon the reason this is the nd best purchase is because my kindly fire hd is st this has been a great purchase and has so many options available when connected with amazon prime i have never been a big tv watched in the last few years but i am back to it a bit with this device coupled with amazon prime i watch movies and tv shows with my wife and it is great if you spend much time in front of the tv then i would say this is a must have and i love it almost as much as my kindly fire hd\",\"does indeed work with shield tv i have the original india shield tv not the latest version and as such i also have the older bunker controller that it came with while it works alright i was never that happy with it just because it s so large and clunky i have smaller hands and never got all that comfortable with it so i went searching for a replacement controller to use with it along came the shield tv and a newly revamped controller looks nice got good reviews but at this time almost impossible to find one new or used for under which is a bit more than i wanted to pay for a controller i found the amazon fire tv controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the shield turns out that the aft controller is not bluetooth but rather wi fi direct did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a shield tv since it s not bluetooth trying to pair this controller with the shield or any other bluetooth device is impossible but at the suggestion of someone on an india forum if you go into the shield s settings and go to the add shield accessory setting while holding the home button on the aft controller after a few moments indeed it does connect and it does work it doesn t show up as a shield accessory since technically it s not so it s kinda weird that way nowhere will you see in the shield s settings or options that the controller is even connected after connecting or pairing the aft controller with my shield i noticed that i lost all sound and audio the aft controller microphone works but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my shield needless to say that summed me out read more\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated

found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting the advantage is that you can use your tv remote to access the content and that is about it htc these are desktop computers or mac minus or android sticks that you load software on to stream video to your tv these can add content that no normal streaming box can access without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn t mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time video game consoles xbox playstation can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams the downside is the cost unless you already have one and the interfaces these consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky you can use other options but frankly they aren t worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do now this amazon product has changed everything it might not be the box for you but honestly there is a good chance that it should be this is a brand new category for amazon and they got a lot right but there are a few shortcomings at least at launch as well so read all of this to see what those are amazon s fire tv boxers nothing else is this fast while roku impressed the world this raises the bar dramatically with a quad core processor and times the memory of any other streaming product it speeds through menus boots quicker starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times the best way i can explain it you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is that much faster voice search is amazing it really works less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time save and makes you wonder why this wasn t done before but it is only for amazon content and veto music videos at least for now you can not use the voice search with netflix for example ready for gaming well at least once you spend another the gaming controller feels a bit price for this type of gaming and really should be or less in my opinion that being said this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a very limited selection on roku but it is not a real console at and honestly shouldn t be compared to them better image quality i know you are thinking i am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally in different apps the video is slightly sharper and clearer we are using the exact same tv settings even the same hdi cable that we used with the roku until we switched it for the fire tv box we have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with roku now i don t know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something as image quality is a huge deal for most folks and normally us steamers have to suffer with decent quality this is certainly worth noting so far we have noticed this under netflix veto and alex cons it lacks soul yes soul the fire tv box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance cold fast efficient unlike roku where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of tico it feels warmer more inviting everything about this box is business like including the interface and the lack of options to change it the interface is more than merely cold it is simply less flashy pretty than the roku interface while fast i am less tempted to wander around like i do on roku it seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the roku interface i will update this more upon extended use the voice search only works for amazon s own content and veto and not most rd party channels like netflix the remote is not ready for gaming use compared to the roku remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements motion another feature about the remote i don t care for is the use of bluetooth instead of wifi roku used to use bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphones jack in the remote it will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned no headphones jack function like roku now to be honest if you use that on the roku it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature missing some popular channels at launch there is no hbo go no m go and no vfd in addition the channel count is much less than roku s at launch channels operate differently on first than the do on roku see my notes below for more information overall this fire tv box took so much from other company s products with only a few missing items they focused on delivering smooth fast performance with less fills than roku for the same price while there are missing channels and features the biggest failure for me personally is the cost of the gaming controller without it this box isn t ready for gaming but adding more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep had amazon included it with every fire tv box they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the roku a poor value if you do not have any streaming box yet i would highly recommend this box over every other product on the market right now i don t make this endorsement lightly i currently own roku boxes because i liked them so much until i used this fire tv box this box means roku will have to really work on improving their product for roku or they will lose the high end market an update my wife officially asked to replace the roku boxes with more fire tv boxes tonight yes these things are that good folks if you have a roku box really look at the missing channels and features are they something you could give up for faster performance also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps if the answer is yes then grab one of these and try it if no wait to see if amazon adds features channels at the very least consider an fire tv box for your next box i do not personally recommend apple tv as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements if you are on a budget and have an android based tablet consider chromecast it is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to roku fire tv i am giving this box a rating compared to a for roku i will update this review regularly for a while so check back for more information also if you have questions or comments please feel free to ask them in the comments section either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them update based on comments i wanted to add a few points regarding comments that i received the item free or are paid by amazon to write this review etc i paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box gray nothing was provided to me nor was i paid anything to write about this device i do not work for amazon i own my own company for this item i am just a customer in fact i didn t expect to even purchase a fire tv prior to it being announced because i figured it would only deal with amazon s own content which i feel is much weaker than netflix in fact i have talked two different family members into getting netflix over amazon s prime streaming service in the past month alone hbo go this has been repeated over and over in the comments but hbo go support for me is not something i am interested in as i do not have cable service anymore nor do i feel that hbo is a better value than netflix i would not go without netflix support at all but i personally think hbo go is more niche for many people and honestly i bet this device will get that channel before too long clearly the hbo go people seem to be pushing the issue but i know streaming box users and none use hbo go so while i noted the missing feature above people still seem to want to beat me up over it update channels it needs to be said that some channels require cable satellite subscriptions to those channels like hbo go not currently on this box showtime espn etc even if you have hbo it does not mean that your provider allows the hbo go so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind i do like the bloomberg tv not available on roku app which actually features a live tv feature netflix app is the older style with the tall covers like vhs boxes instead of the new netflix interface that uses short wide covers like on roku netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the fire tv box doesn t have it yet that makes comparing performance harder from roku to fire tv on my isp provider comcast netflix recently agreed to pay comcast so they have faster streams to customers i do not see a huge improvement in performance in burning like you see on other channels what it does seem to do is start in better quality and or speed the improvement in quality my guess is that the netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware one positive with the first app is that it plays the entire tv episode before switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode i can t tell you how many times i had to click click click and click just to see the end of an episode under roku also the first netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated roku app before going into a tv show first tells you how many total episodes that netflix has on the roku it shows you the number of seasons instead i personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference another point worth mentioning is that the first netflix app shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on that information is missing from the roku netflix app amazon prime content does not loop a feature they should add and likely will this means once you get to the end it just stops instead of keeping going voice search voice search does cover some rd party content despite everyone reporting it works on amazon s content only i have repeated confirmed it supports the veto app and will find music videos in that app that may mean that other rd party apps are covered as well or certainly might be able to be in the future if you search for something that has prime content and veto content it will default to the option with the most options to switch to the other simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or prime search results optical out i noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my lg tv via hdi and then use an optical out to my receiver so i never have to change the receiver s settings so i wasn t excited about this addition to the fire tv box over my roku boxes i stand corrected i decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this fire tv box something that i can not do with roku and it fixed all random lip sync issues i have from time to time on the roku box and the same with the hdi output on this box now i know this is not a typical setup for many people but i do know that tons of people have lip sync issues with hdi connections so being able to bypass the hdi minefield is much more important than i expected veto app this app works better than the roku app performance wise one quick example is that some content simply fails on the roku app try watching britney spears s work b ch don t make fun of me veto can play this video fine on youtube and on the fire tv app but struggles on roku s app some of veto s content is also available via voice search too remote i do miss the jump back button on the remote that roku features it is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn t hear because the phone rang or someone was talking you feel lost without it update they did include this feature but hid it bit you simply double click the reward button to skip back i haven t seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first people do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys this is the way it used to be on roku boxes before someone at roku decided to move it below the directional keys so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it multitasking what multitasking you ask since you haven t seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere i can understand your confusion but try this load a pandora stream then click on the home button and browse for movies tv you want to watch as long as you are in the home amazon prime content you can browse while pandora continues playing now pandora dies when you enter another app like netflix but it shows you that multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features again this tip is only found here another update this tip also works when browsing alex content before you play something so even when utilizing a rd party app it can keep going when it changes to a new song a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist alex app compared to the roku app alex for first is totally different there are some cool features like the backgrounds the screensaver using your photos and the much faster meeting night and day from roku but i do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to online to see i do miss that clicking the play button doesn t play a clip instead you select it click and then play it second click screensaver first has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion i am not saying you can t do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well this functionality covers rd party apps like netflix and alex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts this is the sort of thing you see on pcs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch game changing many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title i said nothing else is this fast to which one commented said nobody cares how fast an streaming box is that s not a game changeractually using it you will see what i mean this is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device like a fast computer which this basically is it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities when amd created their first processor that competed directly with intel s higher end processors it was a game changer correct because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever lowered pricing etc people will look back in years at this moment and say amazon s first changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made instead of barely enough processing power to stream they became able to compete with https and mac minus this is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes i said voice search is amazing and they said not unique by any means my xbox ps tablets all have this and all work amazingly find one person who owns this that doesn t say this voice search works better than anything from google apple or microsoft the fact that little old amazon could out deliver those tech giants is shocking the fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to there is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost i said ready for gaming well at least once you spend another to which they said and stick to basic android games no thanks i have a real console or a couple of them that can play real games this isn t meant to compete with more expensive game consoles it is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes just like tablets cellphone have brought gaming to millions they have not replaced gaming consoles and likely never will just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you can t play on that same console just imagine all the cheap under free games you can enjoy on your first box as i said above in my main review i think amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get polling playing the games but i can understand why they needed to limit their losses again this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device and the only one for a streaming video box every future streaming box will be measured against this one tell me how that isn t game changingplease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone i am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a recently balanced opinion of them hopefully this review has been helpful to you if so please let me know by clicking the button below remember you don t have to agree with everything i said to think it was helpful\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not

know by clicking the button below remember you don t have to agree with everything i said to think it was helpful read more\",\"amazon fire tv a must have this was easy to set up i can access many movies and purchase new releases without going out of the house to search for a video store i can also access my netflix i love this and wondered how i ever lived without it thank you amazon\",\"got it love it amazon is the real deal easy to install and use i m not into the mainstream tv programming so i like to ability to choose what i want to watch and when it has the other similar brands beat hands down\",\"bought one from bestbuy and boy have i been impressed the voice recognition makes finding content so easy even worked with hulu i already had a logo pro so i tried out the games and for a android console they are first racecar better then you which i m sorry to say i ll never use again the tv and music content and menu s are very quick thanks to the very powerful hardware under the hoodoverall i m positive that this unit will kill roku and apple even google chromecast better be careful i own all these units so i speak from experience\",\"works great with one critical flaw having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content i hope that s the case or i will really be disappointed\",\"amazon prime on tv all is as advertised and am enjoying amazon prime on the large screen tv instead of my computer monitor installation and operation a snap\",\"some hulu plus shows are not available many shows that are available on hulu plus website are not available on amazon fire tv hulu plus app a message says that this show can only be viewed at hulu com very disappointing example days of our lives\",\"i love it i just received my fire tv box today and it is everything promised and then some imho i ve been exploring it and got started on cargo for the last hours and the menus are intuitive the voice search is quite nice and i love the way the remote feels in my hand a value buy in my opinion especially if you are an amazon instant video subscriber i haven t even explored all the other sources\",\"amazon billing deceptive practices amazon billed my credit card prematurely on payment date for monthly installment andhave no way to contact amazon to request due date on account not happy at all amazondeducted my payment earlier than agreed terms\",\"it s ok technically the best compared to others on the market my complaint is that the selection of movie apps such as vfd which i have a very large library and the lack of cable apps such as hbo go\",\"a review from a non tech i m your typical middle aged woman i don t game and i m not super tech savvy by any means so take this review for what it is the fire tv was easy to install and i m loving all the features free movies music and simple interface this thing even has a screen save that comes on when you re listening to music we ve always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast demand to watch rent movies but i ll never watch from comcast again the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched it s just so easy to find what you re looking for unlike comcast and since i m an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast demand by a or more so happy with this purchase\",\"amazon fire tv when you add the mlb and pbs aps i will switch from roku roku customer service is terrible and they dont seem to care if you re happy with their product or not\",\"sent mine back out of the box mine updated and setup fine no problems biggest complaint is that voice search only searches amazon and a very few things from huluplus should search all content from at least the big netflix amazonprime huluplus had some picture glitches on huluplus netflix i switched over to my roku on the same content and worked just fine i didn t like the menus not as easy as roku netflix looks and works way better on roku i think this might become a player in the market that roku owns maybe but has too many problems for me to bet on that at full price i might buy one later when they go on sale and the software s been tweaked along with more channels added considering you can buy a roku for the same money or less with a huge list of public private channels also search that really works the fire tv is at this point a very bad choice don t pay them list price to be a fire tv beta tester\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours br br setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple br br the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell br br navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly br br the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote br br i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device br br perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content read more\",\"good start but needs work for starters there are only a few of the free prime shows listed there should be a section where all of the prime shows are placed and easy to find shows should only be listed once and then after clicking the show artwork the seasons available shows are all spread out so it is annoying having to go through them all show seasons aren t even together it is a mess that needs to be sorted yes there is voice search but if you don t know what prime videos are available you could spend days trying to find something to watch or just give up and go to netflix i bought this because it sounded like it would be better than my roku i am not yet convinced it is i know it is early in its release so i will give the developer a little time to fix the problems main problem is lack of prime videos and storage is limited so probably won t use it for games i am on my second day of owning this box an already it is telling me there is a problem loading videos the screen save pictures are nice though also we should be able to attach an external usb drive to download movies and music we buy i have several movies we bought from amazon but they only allow downloading them to windows pc so apple users are better served buying videos from itunes until this policy changes\",\"great and very fast but i noticed within a week that some movies i had watched in the past on prime for free are no longer on the free list and where did all the chick flick movies go we have to pay for each thing now still deciding if this is getting returned or not the equipment is awesome and set up was fast and so so easy but i didn t purchase it to pay for each and everything i want to watch i love amazon and shop all the time but why take the movies off the free list for prime\",\"device unusable for playing video on netflix app i already have roku devices but thought i would give this new amazon device a try this device works fine for the amazon instant video app but there is a terrible lag in the video on the netflix app that makes it unusable on this device i know this issue is not my internet connection as the netflix app works great on the roku devices in addition the user interface on this device is generally just not that great wish i could get a refund and get another roku box\",\"easy to use slick interface and very responsive very happy with purchase i ve been planning on getting a set top box for the past years but just never found something that had everything i was looking for briefly browsing amazon a couple of weeks ago i noticed they had their own recently release online media streaming device after looking over the specs and capabilities i thought it was about time to take the plunge especially since we ve been using amazon prime streaming services more and more now that our daughter watches kid shows i e dora umi zum blues clues etc though we ve only had it around a week we re very happy with the purchase we cut our cable over a year ago so plugging in the computer to the tv every time we wanted to watch something was beginning to get tiresome connection was straightforward and simple on boot it was automatically logged into our prime account not sure how it did this the interface is slick and really easy to find what you re looking for it s very quick not clunky when browsing through video options and for some reason i think it looks better could be mental i know another neat thing is that the remote doesn t have to have line of sight to the front of the box since it utilizes bluetooth it s all about the simple things anyways we re very happy with this little box\",\"i d love to see amazon take a netflix model for a i own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the amazon fire tv falls into more of the apple tv category it s definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon s prime tv offerings you can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less extensively than on demand options available from your cable provider however for your prime investment there are no free titles i d love to see amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles the price barrier keeps me from watching older titles but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it the interface is great i find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use it s really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available performance is best in class as the fire tv has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider i d love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment however for an all in one solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot i use the alex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great certainly there s no blu ray player that can match the capability of this device all in all i definitely recommend this device to anyone but still prefer the roku since roku isn t selling its own content service so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn t even know existed\",\"no universal search no way to search prime free content no headphones jack no logo no volume control adding apps is hard listen i am basically an amazon fancy i do a lot of shopping thru amazon so it pains me to write this review but it s got ta be done corporate stupidity just has to be addressed i have a couple roku s a google chromecast a couple tico s etc voice search is nice but searching overall is unacceptable as it is not a universal search like on roku i e search all sources for a movie etc not just amazon will there ever be a way amazon are you listening to search prime for the free content the fire tv doesn t do it unacceptable the roku has a headphones jack on the remote brilliant this simply has to be a standard feature on these kinds of boxes but the fire tv does not have it unacceptable no logo unacceptable no volume control ok none of these boxes have what would be a very desirable feature a volume control on the remote so the fire tv does not lack here compared to the competition but it sure seems like amazon should have figured out how desirable a volume control would be and included it adding android apps is very hard for average users\",\"a mess stick with roku simple and effective i wish i could send the fire tv back to operate the fire tv is just a unnecessary mess even the mic could not find a program on fire tv netflix that is on roku netflix to me i don t need all the bs to watch a program i ll get another roku and be happy\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no

read more\",\"pretty good so far ok first off if you are looking to get one of these things dont put all your eggs on one basket as far as other reviewers go the bad ones i think are just haters apple lovers people who dont have one or have nothing better to do but to not give thing a proper review i got mine yesterday and had a few hours to play with it and use it i have xbox and used that for my netflix and amazon prime but wanted something else to do that with so amazon came out with this and ordered it here is a list of good and bad but understand i dont own apple or roku the good the speed and response on this thing is very very fast the video quality is great it truly is p i think that is better the what my xbox puts out the sound quality is great i used a hdi plugged it in to my and sounds great the hook up was very easy and straight forward it is a plug and play looking up to home network was very simple i use the wireless and it so far runs flawless the remote is small and very simple and not complicated very straight forward and very smooth the movie and show load up time is very instant with my netflix it took no time at all to load up unlike my xbox this is the best part i thing anyway and so far no has said anything about this is that you can take it with you on a trip as long as the t v has a hdi and you can get on the wireless you can watch your programs or movies on any t v i think that is the best part about it all it is small and very light the voice search works really well cons and these may not be cons or bad for you the voice search will only find movies or programs on amazon prime but from what i hear that is cause of a deal thing with the other providers and that may change in the further you can not power it down or put it to sleep but for me that is no big deal and really you can just plug it if you want summary over all i find this unit works really well and it is very responsive i have yet to see any lag with the things that i have watched or played with note i have not used the games for this so this is only for the programs i put it through its paces for the few hours that i have used it and so far i think that amazon did a pretty good job with this note after looking at the box and reading the back of the box there is a note that says there will be a spring update so my thinking is that the stuff that is missing or things that are not there will be coming soon just remember that this just came out a few days ago and i am sure that things will only get better in time\",\"i am not pleased every movie i select is a pay for i am not pleased every movie i select is a pay for view it s a good thing netflix on it every movie that is a pay for view can be found on netflix i don t need this device netflix is available on cable one\",\"great device with some issues but overall great device first i would like to say that i am coming from using google tv fire tv is a great device the voice search is accurate at picking up what i say my biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search coming from google tv if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places lets say i am searching for the movie remains on google tv it would look for it in netflix amazon instant instant prime google play store hbo go and you get the idea this device for example will not check netflix so i must do a voice search to see if it is on amazon if not i must open lets say netflix and use the up down left right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on netflix that was the big issue for me a small issue is the amount of apps no hbo go google play store and others i am not blaming amazon for this it is an open system so hbo and others just need to make the apps for it this devise is quick and amazon items start up instantly but not netflix netflix must load first but that is not a big deal if you are wondering why i am switching from google tv it is because google neglected it and it hasn t received updates in a long time i think google gave up on it\",\"awesome streaming device we ditched cable two years ago and live on netflix and amazon prime the fire tv is for our second tv it setup fast though i was disappointed that it spent five minutes updating initially the intro was fast professional and showed the basic features we currently use a sony blu ray player for our primary tv the fire tv is much faster to key through screens and items the antenna for the wifi is superior connecting our upstairs tv to the downstairs wireless router the fire tv starts streaming content instantly no boot up time we are very happy to add this streaming device to our home\",\"from a roku owner and now fire tv this review is to try to offset some of roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device the first thing you notice after plugging everything in is a minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass even if you know your way around these types of devices you will only see it once and then you re good to go the device is small and beautiful the remote is better than any other device including roku and my wd tv live first the pros it s the fastest media streamer by far that s not only a good thing if you own one but it will force roku and other companies to stop skipping on the hardware and firmware updating the menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver you can t move things around yet but i m sure they will eventually let you customize your own page as of now the apps which would be at the top if i could change it are at the bottom apps are larger and higher resolution than the roku the voice button is amazing for a first attempt they almost got it right i understand this is a proprietary device so they will always want you to use amazon instant video for your viewing but this option should search for all of your linked accounts including hulu netflix etc i m not sure that they will ever fix this because they will lose money and viewers even so it s still a pro because it does work well streaming quality wow everything i ve tried buffers so quickly that it s almost already at p when it starts playing with my roku netflix looks great but it takes seconds to get there i currently have maps of internet so i m not sure what everyone else goes through but i can tell you this streams better than roku period overheating and reboot my roku can not handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs it gets exhausted and it has to reset itself this device is more powerful and after using it all day today i can say my roku will be immediately up for sale once they add the time warner cable and logo apps alex okay i always blamed my alex for the long delays on my roku with my internet speeds i could never understand why it was always loading at p settings regardless of the nitrate anyway i was wrong it s the device not only does the fire tv have a much better alex app which is beautiful btw but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds no re loading suffering during movie playback and the movies are in a much nicer grid layout so i don t have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection now the cons obviously it s still missing some apps you are crazy if you think logo will go much longer without being added the same for other apps they built it so they will come interface it is nice but as i stated in the pros you can t make changes to it hopefully just for now if it stays this way it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps one major issue that is very upsetting to me is the fact that they couldn t add two very important things usb and ac if amazon claims they were listening they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience i haven t plugged my wd tb hard to it yet but it is a hard drive now it will unfortunately revert to speeds don t build a supposedly forward thinking device with two things that are now considered dated i have a feeling this was done to make money off the fire tv thanks for that overall it is the best device currently available and they really made the experience fun it does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service buy it you will not regret it\",\"fantastic right out of the box the fire tv came well packaged with extremely simple instructions plug in the power cable and hdi cable not included put batteries in the remote and that s it after initial start up there is an update that must be run but after a few minutes the unit was up and running interface is nice looking and easy to use voice search worked perfectly it understood this kentucky accent instantly flipping through the movie choices is super fast almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two netflix is on the home page but you have to install the app before using it the first time as i m typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while i have a movie paused if you store your photos on amazon s cloud you can use your own pictures instead picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast the only thing i see as a con would be how the prime movies are marked the placement of the prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn t as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it s prime or a movie you would rent purchase i figure in the days and weeks ahead amazon will be listening to customer suggestions as they usually do and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better for me the amazon fire tv is a winner it will definitely be replacing a direct receiver i was using update after one full day of using amazon s fire tv i am more than satisfied with my purchase if you read reviews like i do make sure to skip over the ones that don t have the amazon verified purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful these are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession if you discount those reviews which make the overall rating less than it should be you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied update added the amazonbasics digital optical audio nolink cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv the sounds are more richer and louder than ever before i am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of i really suggest getting the cable i mentioned above to make your fire tv experience even better update turned on the device today and went to start up netflix all i got was a white screen turned the unit off and on but still a white screen i installed the netflix app and installed and it worked again i don t believe it was a problem on the device itself but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine update had the same white screen issue with netflix some more contacted customer service and reported the issue he stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps when you come to netflix instead of installing click on force stop this fixed the issue if i have the problem again he asked that i contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue i continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the direct receiver i had connected i can t recommend the fire tv enough update my fire tv is still going strong and i am completely happy with it i have found that i watch tv more so on the fire than my direct the one thing i haven t checked but will sometime is the usb port i ve got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if i can play a saved movie from the drive using the usb port on the fire finding amazon content is a breeze using the voice search and searching through movies or videos using netflix and others is fine yes it would be great to be able to use the voice search with everything else but it s not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience i would imagine amazon will eventually include their voice search on any third party application as time allows even after using it all this time i m still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device for me amazon just gets better and better update i had movies saved to an external hard drive and i plugged it into the usb port on the amazon fire unfortunately it doesn t work it basically did nothing it made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any usb plugged in hopefully amazon will push out an update to fix this at some point and time it would be a wonderful feature to have hint hint amazon\",\"unique place in the market perfect for the amazon ecosystem well after using it last night and sleeping on it the experience didn t actually sleep on my fire tv i had been debating between and stars i am a longtime media streamer i have roku and have bought more as gifts to family i also have a comcast and an xbox additionally i have tried various other streaming devices such as netgear not the d link movienite etc i am still trying to figure out why i bought the chromecast the least useful gadget i have ever owned first of all the fire tv is everything that amazon claims it is it is fast it is sleek the interface is handsome and of course very kindly fire like after looking it up it immediately downloaded updates an annoying process that almost every new computing device does whether it is a phone tablet streamer or computer it seems to take forever but it is really not that long it is just that we are in christmas morning opening presents mode and time slows down when you are excited about trying something new i give it stars because amazon delivered what it said it would i doubt it will replace anyone s existing favorite i would recommend it to anyone just entering the streaming media game and who has kids and amazon prime it is a fantastic portal to amazon products many people have tried to compare it to roku apple chromecast etc but to me i compare it to my xbox it plays video music and games so for some who want to have a less expensive alternative to an xbox one there it is of course you can not compare it xbox one or ps but not everyone wants to shell out dollars for a game or for a game console this is plenty for the casual gamer or kids being on the android platform will allow the number of apps to increase exponentially and for watching amazon s videos prime and pay it is perfect about the experience for amazon s offerings it is the best out there i highly recommend amazon prime as it is comparable to netflix plus i have saved a bundle on free shipping the interface for the movies is first class the remote s ff and rw buttons also act as skip forward and skip back buttons press rw once to jump back seconds or hold to rewind same for the ff button the interface for amazon video is similar to the new one for netflix on roku with the entire screens background feature the highlight movie surprising the interface for netflix on fire tv is the older one not the new one the alex app works fine for all my dna needs playing media from my home computers wish list allow us to change the position of apps when you start adding apps the latest one is the first one on the list so add them in reverse order to get your most frequently used ones at the top of the list there is a row of tiles for recently watched that allow you remove from that list but it is sludge those of you who have a kindly fire will recognize the system or add a quick access or favorites row of tiles at the top of the home screen would love to have amazon tie into the ultraviolet system i have close to movies there you can reach it through the flixster app but hd is not available on the flixster app logo vfd logo vfd logo vuduamazon get my pointing summary i will keep it and use it for amazon offerings it will sit beside my roku which i will use for everything else until the apps on my roku get ported to fire i do wish it had and infrared sensor so my harmony remote could use it but it is not a showstopper\",\"love our first voice search will totally spoil you this was so easy to set up we were up running in less than minutes and wow this is primarily my hobby s toy i play on the computer he flies the tv voice search is such a timesaver i used to have to stop whatever i was doing to type in whatever he needed to search for now he can handle it speak and ye shall find love love love this both speed of the video loading is awesome as is the intuitive search function amazon knows what he likes so his lists are more or less pre filtered so they load faster i baffled for weeks before buying this i read tons of reviews finally decided it would be worth the temporary honey how do i do this change in look feel etc we ve been streaming with a roku since about had the roku xd for a long time just before the change to first finally i decided to try it thinking if hobby had too much difficulty adapting we d just send it back while also trusting amazon to have made a massive leap forward have never myself been disappointed with any of their electronic offerings i was expecting to have to sync it with our router sign on to our accounts again and again amazon netflix etc note plug it in it turned itself on updated itself found my router was pre loaded with my amazon account we were from box to watching in under minutes there s even a or minute cartoon tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know to stream use your remote easy breeze when he wanted to try netflix he was able to easily click to install an app then i painfully used a grid keyboard to logo to netflix account username pid only once and we were done the voice search is such a leap forward it s incredible and accurate can voice search by title genre director actor everything and it even understands southern woohooit has times the processing speed and times the memory of our previous roku box wow what a difference in longtime resolution quality of picture vividness of color just awesome what can i say amazon did it again movie program descriptions are displayed at the bottom of the screen my only bubbling complaint is you can t change the font size on descriptions w o altering tv resolution which i won t do they do have excellent closed rationing functionality for those who need it you can enlarge the fonts there for easy readability basically i m very happy we took the plunge it really was a worthwhile improvement for us we prefer amazon s video streaming anyway they have lots more documentaries than the other streaming services i m just sorry i waited so long quick update not all apps come reloaded on the device though a ton of others did pandora bloomberg showtime anytime netflix veto vimeo watches tackle huluplus iheartradio and tuneinradio if you have an amazon kindly tablet i m guessing like the dx you can somehow toss photos from the tablet directly to the fire meaning sitting in your living room you can apparently swine the photo across the screen and it lands on the fire don t have that so can t do that however we do have many photos saved to amazon s cloud drive they were all accessible from the first console via the tv with just a click even a short family video we d uploaded with no interference from me just clicked on photos there they were easy a very nice feature\",\"amazon prime membership just got better with first just setup my new first ordered via my amazon account and so far so good so fast setup time minutes the good no setup to access amazon content i am already a prime member so once i had my wifi setup the first did a quick scan of the internet for updates before running the tutorial video to my surprise once the tutorial was completed i was welcomed by web my amazon username hello insert name complete with my watch list and video library no additional steps needed to access my content cool and creepy at the same time but who am i kidding my electronic footprint is large super fast the first interface content menu system is quick and straightforward it s a better faster interface than any of my other devices i own that streams amazon content ps xbox deprecated ipad video smart and wifi enabled bd player i do not have a netflix membership so i haven t tried it yet maybe there s a free trial attached but will amazon allow that i played a movie out of my amazon video library and it started instantly missing is the your content is still loading delay i am telling you the movie started immediately prime content i read some comments that stated posters had trouble being able to easily identify prime content i am not having the same problem all prime content displays the blue prime banner in the upper left hand corner as it does on all the other devices mentioned above so maybe there has been a software update since which means amazon heard you power i was concerned over the lack of a power button on the remote or first unit itself which i thought meant the device would have to be manually disconnected from the power source not so the device goes to sleep no power led activity after a set period of time and is easily awaken by the press of a button on the remote perfect the bad haven t found it yet\",\"fire tv apple tv chromecast in addition to the fire tv i have an apple tv as well as a chromecast by far and large the best product is the fire tv i use it more than both the other ones combined having integration between my prime list and the device is clutch as i consume media across several different devices i do wish i could search by prime instant so i hope they will fix that i also wish i could cast a prime instant streaming video from a device to the fire tv but i don t see that as an option although i can cast youtube to my fire tv which is really cool there is no doubt that it is faster than both apple tv and chromecast and the voice recognition is so convenient i also have the game controller and the games are pretty good i don t game much but i wanted to check it out i was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement i d also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this both chromecast and apple tv have this from an educator s standpoint this could be the solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers apple tv doesn t play well with enterprise level security and chromecast doesn t do well with some software that is essential for instruction all in all it s my favorite media device it s faster has a great and happy ui and is easy to setup\",\"nice some content was found but unavailable as an owner of various models of roku and apple tvs i didn t really need yet another streaming device but i decided to give it a try it works great i do like the voice search feature we tried watching some of our favorites like midsommer murders all of the seasons and episodes showed up which was nice but only a few of the earlier seasons were watchable for free and a few of the more recent were available for but most were unavailable that happened to several other bbc series that we tried to watch however the movies we have watched streamed without a hitch with good picture and sound\",\"prime video and netflix bought my amazon fire to take better advantage of prime video and my wife s netflix account it s great easy to set up the voice search works really well love the simplicity and for us it was the perfect way to add streaming media to our main tv\",\"best tv streaming box for everyone from grand to your computer science professor after having the first for about a month now i can confidently recommend this product for most people versus the current generation apple tv chromecast and roku offerings the first is the best value due to it s access to a wide variety of content build quality and advanced features it s a device i have recommended to my almost elderly parents my geek friends best things about the first it is fast unlike the roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product has amazon prime video access if you have prime membership this is the best accessory you can buy lots of great content from comedy central and newer movies versus netflix an appstore with apps games you actually want alex showtime anytime are the big difference makers imo if you have local video files on your network alex is the way to go voice searchworst things about the first which really aren t that bad annoying long intro video upon the first time you boot up larger power adapter versus apple tv yes the little things count no logo until late going to be a problem from the folks looking for their game of thrones fix this spring no chromecast airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet if you don t need logo right now and don t have a bunch of apple products stop reading this right now and buy this device you won t regret it see below for ways around this you are an advanced user and or are on the fence this next section is for you before the first i had apple tv s in my house that i used to access logo hulu netflix my local media through the infused application i had tried roku s chromecast and other media boxes home theater pc s and the apple tv worked best for me while this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks lack of p video limited app selection no games etc which led me to trying the first because the first is based on android android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine the steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your first you may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy you ll need them to get a few things running any old usb keyboard mouse you have lying around should work ok the following links provide the best directions i have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too but no promises how to sideload applications to the first the first step in loading android apps is getting adb set up on your machine can be done by following amazon s directions developer amazon com appsandservices solutions devices fire tv docs connecting adb after that you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications also by following amazon s directions developer amazon com sdk as app install html if you aren t comfortable with working with the command line and are running windows you can try this great gui application to automatically side load applications forum da developers com showthread php once you are able to send android apps apk files to the first i recommend installing player to allow mk avi video file playback sites

non tech people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m your typical middle aged woman i don t game and i m not super tech savvy by any means so take this review for what it is the fire tv was easy to install and i m loving all the features free movies music and simple interface this thing even has a screen save that comes on when you re listening to music we ve always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast demand to watch rent movies but i ll never watch from comcast again the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched it s just so easy to find what you re looking for unlike comcast and since i m an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast demand by a or more so happy with this purchase\",\"as compared to roku for amazon streaming i love my amazon prime membership i use it to stream tv and movies and i love that i can download content to my fire as well i bought a roku a couple of years ago and it has truly changed the way i use my prime membership because i use it for tv and movies it reaffirmed that the new price is worth it i had been considering buying a second roku for a secondary tv but when i saw this new device i bought it right away here are my thoughts set ups simple to set up including opening the package it took me minutes i timed it all i had to do was connect the device to the hdi and plug it in then i put in my wifi password because the device is so slim and small i have it sitting under my ndtv on the console i feel like the cords are seater there it took an additional minutes to update the software so it did take a while to actually be able to use it i loved that as soon as it finished loading a short fun and helpful startup instructional video ran since i bought it for myself on amazon it was automatically uploaded with my account info navigating amazon video contentid gave me the option to add parental controls in the form of a pin to my account which i did because i didn t want my kids to accidentally or on purpose buy an episode at first i was frustrated by this because amazon prime content wasn t showing up if i tried to access something on my watchlist i had to select other viewing options to watch via prime i m still not sure why this is then i still had to put my pin in which made me wonder if i was buying it i went to settings and was able to leave the pin on for purchased content and turn it off for prime content which is what i want then it made it easier to access the prime content voice searchthis does work it s great you push the button on the remote and speak the title or actor amazingly intuitive apps added the youtube app and it was easy to sign in to my account and access my videos i m sure my kids will love this as compared to roku m still out on this the roku which is the one i have is at least twenty dollars cheaper and is what i was planning to buy for my nd tv i really like the voice search feature over the roku search and it does seem to be faster however the navigation of the actual prime content isn t as easy to access as on the amazon app on the roku part of it might be familiarity but it seems like it s easier to find prime content via the app on the roku than the tv movie section on the fire tv it doesn t seem to have prime set apart separately like on the app i use on the roku i do like the games availability and think my year old son will enjoy it it was one thing that caused me to buy it he enjoys playing angry birds on the roku but that s where it ends there it also comes with coin credit to use\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content i hope that s the case or i will really be disappointed read more\",\"gh performance is awesome but lacks critical features oddly this device deserves both a five star rating and a star rating at the same time the things they did right they did really really right and blow the competition out of the water but there are serious omissions that i believe an average television watched is going to surely miss for watching amazon content this device is glorious smooth extremely fast easy and convenient the performance is truly impressive and definitely best in class the voice search worked great for me although i am not pushing it to its limits with a medium range voice and no accent i love how it was already linked to my account since i purchased it from amazon classy touch major omissions annoyance the remote will not control your tv so for turning the tv on off and adjusting volume you will still need another remote other content providers netflix pandora etc are not integrated with voice search so your voice search will only call up amazon content and to access the others you have to enter into the app explicitly and use an on screen hunt and pick style interface to search i am hopeful that either the content providers will remedy this in the future or amazon will sell a bluetooth keyboard for the thing perhaps just make my google keyboard work also it does not come with an hdi cable most people probably already have a cable they can use but i can only imagine the frustration of someone purchasing this and not having the ability to plug it in this device in its current state will not really replace other devices you have it would most likely just be an added item for watching amazon content so a cable should have been included obviously this is a first impression review the fire tv was released yesterday some of my first annoyance could be remedied by a future software update but i don t recommend you buy this product just yet i am going to keep mine a few days to explore further and then probably send it back i will update this review\",\"fire tv vs

ve made this to illustrate the current works of fire tv s voice search feature it appears to be limited to amazon content at least for videos i believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music i am searching for house of cards season a netflix original i am a netflix subscriber so i would expect the netflix listing to be displayed but fire tv only returns the show s season available for purchase at amazon and does does not list netflix at all as a netflix subscriber i could watch both seasons and for free but according to fire tv s search season doesn t exist and i d have to pay per episode if i wanted to watch season see how roku s search second half of video correctly shows that season is available from netflix amazon go and vfd and that i can get get season from netflix it s also telling me checkmarks that i subscribe to of the services listed it s up to everyone to weigh amazon s faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns amazon only content vs roku s ability to find content across the channels services it carries review begins here as a current former owner and user of steamers such as roku roku stick and google s chromecast and also streaming gaming platforms such as ps ps and xbox one i believe i can do a fair assessment on what amazon s fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives i rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and hopefully my assessment of amazon s fire tv may help others decide whether this is what they need or want broad assessmentthe fire tv will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace from what i ve experienced so far due to its tight integration with the fire dx tablets and amazon s own instant video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the amazon tablet and already subscribers to amazon s prime its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non hard core gamers for everybody else depending on one s specific needs and expectations the fire tv may or may not be the right streamer to buy as one who purchased amazon s original kindly fire on day one and went through several generations of amazon s kindly reader i expect that amazon s streamer will also evolve or grow overtime amazon will listen to us and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting new and improved more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants until then i would say that the current fire tv is a competent amazon content biased through search streamer with gaming capabilities lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search offset by its currently favoring amazon s service and the user interface in general parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching if all you want is streaming and don t care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don t need contentthe fire tv offers most but not all mainstream services and i suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and i am sure that more services will be added in time however at this time amazon s selection pages when compared to roku s wildly diverse channels but the roku have been around for a while all mainstream services now on fire tv are also available on roku ps xbox one and many on google s chromecast fire tv attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from amazon s instant video by comparison roku offer text based cross service search with results returned from most big providers amazon s attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so time will tell the soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish amazon s product from the competition once they are implemented innovationamazon s great innovative revolutionary disruptive device was the kindly reader and the enhanced kindly paperwhite i suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as forests instead of recyclable material these days because of the kindly amazon s fire tablets are nice but they are tablets the fire tv streamer gaming device falls probably under okay or interesting steamers and not too bad gaming platforms the quad core cpu is also nice but whether i m streaming on a significantly more powerful ps or a tiny one core cpu chromecast the video audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable i assume that the reason for a more powerful cpu is the game playing part the lack of large permanent storage had implies that as a gaming platform the fire tv will allow for mostly small to medium size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage again a feature that may not be suitable for those whose isis charge by the megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers game playing on the fire tv works but those used with big console s lag free controllers that rumble talk back and sense motion may not view the fire tv as a serious gaming platform i would say that amazon s streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation it s a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that s still okay valuethere s very little that amazon s fire tv does that other platforms don t do the ps and the xbox one are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good steamers and multimedia machines only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more the chromecast and the roku are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and pcs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet they are also somewhat more difficult to setup small steamers such as the roku stick and the chromecast are very portable as they fit into one s shirt pocket amazon s fire tv could be carried around at least in theory but it s not as easy to move around roku is still the leader of content but amazon s selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time the fire tv costs a lot more than a roku or a chromecast but even if a gaming controller is added is still less than a ps or an xbox voice search as implemented on fire tv at the time i am writing this restricted to amazon and veto is in effect hiding content from other services potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a free stream who needs anyone who already has one or more roku chromecast or xbox playstation in their homes probably don t need one at this time unless they are tightly integrated into amazon s ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching those who are looking for their first streamer should consider fire tv s ease of use beats the chromecast but it s probably on par with roku and the xbox playstation amazon s great user support roku s enormous channels selection playstation and xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms if you don t mind paying up to for newly released games amazon s attempt to keep their users confined to amazon s own hardware platforms and content streams vs roku s and chromecast relative openness fire tv s split gaming streaming personality jack of trades vs roku s and chromecast focus on streaming price of course s not an easy decision to make i would be very happy with the fire tv if it was the first streamer device in the house with so many stream capable and game playing boxes sticks already operating and doing well i like amazon s fire tv for being a well designed capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but i also like and i ve been using the roku for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my chrome browser to the tv i hope that amazon s search will soon expand to cover non amazon services or it won t be a useful tool i may not have the the fire tv attached to the big tv in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful kindly and amazon prime user asked for it in her room\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it

amazon prime videos that is a disclaimer that should be noted somewhere at least in small print\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips and hbo go of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes read more\",\"a review from a non tech of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m your typical middle aged woman i don t game and i m not super tech savvy by any

ordered this as soon as it was available and it arrived this morning for background i also have an apple tv which i hate but my kids love i also have various wdt models which i love the reason the kids love the apple tv is that the interface is so slick and quick which the wdt certainly lacks in this fire tv is even better imo than the apple tv and the wdt doesn t even come close unfortunately the fire tv misses in a huge way for me by not allowing the play of external content through the usb port from attached storage or memory stick if it had that capability and hopefully it will in the future this would be the perfect device this is why i am still hanging on to my wdt as my go to player it will play virtually any file format you throw at it which is a priority to me i have been reading about the alex app and that may satisfy my needs as well but i haven t dug deeper or tested it out if that is not the case for you than the fire tv would be a great option i am not familiar with roku because i could never justify the purchase due to the inability to play content from local storage unfortunately i jumped the gun with the fire tv because i saw that it did have a usb port and made the assumption it would support external content hopefully this will come in a future firmware release otherwise maybe alex will be able to fill that gap for me bottom line if external content is not important i would recommend this fire tv due to the availability of prime content and the fact the interface is beautiful and very quick the apple tv should only be a consideration over this if you are a fanatic apple loyalist or you have a tremendous amount of itunes content you want to be able to

what a great choice i am so happy with both the case the kindly so bright cheerful just like a sunny day\",\"stand wears out quickly one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this works as a case and matches the color of the kindly nicely the main feature i wanted was the stand however it is only one corner flap as pictured i incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved there is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward starting out my kindly would sit at a nice degree or so angle from the table but now my kindly will sit at maybe degrees off the table eventually it will just go flat i ve had it for maybe weeks if the stand feature is important to you get a different case\",\"perfect for the little ones great sturdy case perfect for my three year old\",\"looks nice it s pretty and matches my fire tablet and i like that it s slim and doesn t add a lot of bulk to the tablet it could be improved if it had a hand strap to make holding it easier but i bought a separate hand strap that fits with it\",\"great great for kids makes it easy for them to hold the fire and great protection for when it drops nothing protecting the screen though but so far that hasn t been an issue\",\"replacement cover from amazon under warranty the case that came with my oasis had an edge that wasn t quite glued down amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless it detached from the oasis quickly and easily i pull the kindly off when i m holding it one handed and pop it right back in when finished my only complain which is a minor one is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt but i don t know that there s a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen in any case it s a brilliant bit of kit and i would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one i have now\",\"major fan didn t buy this because of protection major fan didn t buy this because of protection bought it cause it will blend in to my decor it is not a skin so it s not skin tight yes it s loose but how often will you grab it and move it me maybe once every year\",\"good quality case nice case that my daughter needed for her new kindly she earned nice and sturdy its actually better than i thought it would be and serves its purpose\",\"didn t like my niece was used to carrying around my tablet with a handle on the case this one is not good for toddler to handle\",\"this case is overall quite nice but has started to peel apart on the this case is overall quite nice but has started to peel apart on the edges a little i will try to update this review later on after i see how it holds up the tablet automatically locks and wakes the screen when closing and opening the case which i think is the most appealing part about this case\",\"love my oasis this cover though eh edit after three months of use i still don t love it it works well no complaints but it marks up easily and the sides began flanking off my original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back i was much more careful with the merit and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time and the flak thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap and for i would expect real leather so i switched back to my original black cover and i m just letting it age with the device i guess the plus side is that the merit made me like the black cover more but the downside is it cost to do so ridiculous as stated in the title i love my oasis i ve had it for about six months and with the exception of the defective first one i received which was promptly replaced i haven t had a problem out of it i had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice always however a couple of months ago i had gotten a screen protector and skin for the oasis and i just wasn t feeling the black cover anymore i had considered the merit i think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch but i despise brown leather so i gave in after much consideration and ordered it it didn t arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with but after a quick call to customer service i had a new tracking number it finally arrived today i am disappointed to say that i don t love it it smells funny as i done remember my original doing the color is fuller than in the picture maybe my expectations had overflow due to the wait and the whole two tracking numbers thing but i just don t love it read more\",\"just bad in this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this it covers the fire fine the fit is sung and snaps into place no problem a hidden magnet auto wakes sleeps the display when you open close it the fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of dropping up fire when you want to use it hands free you can get it to stay but it often slides out or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle whether it s in portrait or landscape orientation the stand on the back is so work that you re better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place\",\"great case for a great tablet this is a great case it allows access to all ports and camera while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself it feels very durable and i think it would protect the fire well against accidental drops bumps and scratches as a blind individual touch is very important to me this product feels well made it feels expensive and i m certain looks the same the standing feature is great it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape this is a great accessory for the new fire i m sure there will be other companies making cases for it but this is how the folks at amazon envisioned their device and it is amazing don t be fooled in to buying a cheaper product amazon devices do best with amazon accessories\",\"nice and sturdy case this case is great it s inexpensive slim and very sturdy i have another kindly fire that s a little bigger so the case is somewhat heavy and bulky in comparison this case is very lightweight yet still protective\",\"cover material is very disappointing i have purchased several amazon fire cases in the past and have been delighted in the streamlined design and the vinyl covering very easy to keep clean this new design for the fire hd is fabric how long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean i can not see any easy way to clean it like i do with the vinyl covers i bought one for myself as well as my mother i will keep them but i sure hope they don t turn around and produce vinyl ones after all the concerns i am sure will be coming i won t be able to afford two more\",\"fire in the kitchen oh my ending word this has better sound than my hp laptop with one of the standing cases you can turn it into a kitchen tv by laying the flap on the bottom shelf of a cabinet above your counter and then placing a can of something on the flap to make sure it stays there gently close the cabinet door and it stays there hanging down so you can watch something while you prepare dinner the standing cases work but i don t want my kindly on the counter top near any possibly slashing liquids so i started doing the hanging thing i say screw formality and lets do things a different way\",\"price one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no the case does what it is supposed to do i think because i bought the tablet amazon should have reduced the price of case too price but i wanted a perfectly fitted case and not something that would or would not be compatible\",\"huge design flaw good cover love the standing feature one big flaw it need cut outs for the speakers when shut music still plays when active and cover closed to protect screen but there are no cut outs for the speakers thus destroying the sound this is a huge design flaw for the case\",\"i brought this for my year old granangel i brought this for my year old granangel she loves it the size is just right the child proof case is ideal for her\",\"great case this thing does it s job perfectly it s light weight and provides great protection not worried about it when in the little ones hands or not as the case may be\",\"perfect fit for fire tablet fits perfect on the new fire kids tablet thanks so much for another great product\",\"just fine i ve had the new fire hd with the case for about a week i use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobook so far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed why is that there is no reason i can think of why my volume needs should change because i closed the lid btw the marine blue is lovely the speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre is noticeably diminished this is a design flaw that needs to be fixed i purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini for the price the fire tablet is a reasonable replacement\",\"save your money i typically don t post reviews however don t waste your money on this case i got it on friday and started using it that evening its now thursday and the case is feeling at the edges the fabric around the camera hole has started bubbling and the felt on the inside edge is wearing off i have not had any issues with it standing on its own like other people have mentioned i am giving this a two star mainly because it is still functional i am tempted to send it back but i like the functionality of this case\",\"great color one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i replaced the brown sued cover that came with my kindly because i d dropped it a couple of times and it had problems staying connected it wouldn t charge so it was pretty much useless i went with the leather cover because the sued cover while nice to touch did get worn i had one on my old kindly paper white so i decided a leather cover would be better the color is as lovely as a glass of merit and stays connected so far i love using this new kindly oasis because it s so much lighter than my old paper white\",\"it s a nice color it fits the fire very well one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no it s a nice color it fits the fire very well however i can not stand it on it s side unless i reverse the fire and put the right side on the bottom the stand does not work on it s left side the way the diagram shows\",\"updated review after months i am updating my review from two months ago my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review i originally did not recommend this product but after living with it and growing to like it i am changing my recommendation the truth is the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall also it has been sat into a paddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock but it isn t as big of a problem as i thought it would be i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it leaving the top of the sling on easy off and easy back on after my only real lingering complaint would be the price for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive i am increasing my stars by one really the price is the only thing keeping this from a star for me i have come to really like the sling i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean safe while throwing it into a work bag my original is below overall i would and have recommended the sling to protect the tap received the tap and the sling cover in the last hours read more\",\"huge step down from the older version still not really in love with the new kindly itself on the fence about returning it but this case is just horror it says it stands it doesn t it just collapses no matter position it s in it s flimsy and scratch and does just about nothing complete waste of money\",\"a nice case that works well to protect your tablet this is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new inch kindly fire inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your kindly into the frame solidly holds your kindly into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops the case weighs in at ounces the exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish it is available in canary yellow charcoal black cobalt blue marine blue and punch red the one in my video is marine blue the top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened the cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover i like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power the inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed i like that the micro sd card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case that helps to protect the sd card from being lost or quickly stolen a large memory size sd card can cost to almost and the added security is helpful the tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video i show this in my product video all of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case that includes the volume controls the headphones jack the microphone the power charging port and the power on off button the cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading browsing the internet or watching movies read more\",\"i like my amazon fire tablet case love the color of the cas and seems to protect well loving this case\",\"an excellent choice for a good looking and durable case to protect amazon s new fire hd tablet over the years i ve tried a variety of cases for the various models of kindly and fire tablet that i ve purchased from amazon while i ve found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive i found myself coming back to amazon s own product when i purchased one of their new fire hd tablets and i m pleased with it this is a very good quality cover it fits well and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation it s made of fabric on the outside with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed it matches the color of the fire tablet perfectly my only hesitation in purchasing it was the price the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the fire tablet but i suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is than how expensive the case is kind of still i decided to spend the money for this case the tablet needs the protection and i know from experience that amazon s cases are durable and will last for a long time i ve used my original kindly paperwhite first generation model with the amazon leather case since it was first purchased i ll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet i m very satisfied with it notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is dropped up in landscape mode\",\"doesn t hold up to description price too high for what it is the case is cute and a nice color fabric is nice seems it will hold up problem is it doesn t stand up as described mine doesn t stand up at all priced is too high for what it is in my opinion i wouldn t buy this case again\",\"don t waste your money on this this is a horrible an overpriced case i ve had this case for less than two weeks and it s already coming apart the little rubber stitching around the case is falling off\",\"you need to remove the case to access the sd slot this is a good thing all in all i am impressed with my primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions nevertheless has received the and installed the product i believe that i meets my specific needs and expectation this case is unlikely to protect my fire hd in a foot drop it does however protect my kindly from spills and low drops what i want and what i have is the ability to without forethought turn off the kindly when the cover is closed to save power moreover whether by design or oversight the fact that the sd card is covered e g you need to remove the case to access the sd slot this is a good thing all in all i am impressed with product s fit e g the camera hole is perfectly aligned the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions bottom line i m happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration\",\"great buy great case fits kindly fire perfect\",\"great cover this is a great cover it turns the device on and off by opening and closing and works as a great stand with it either vertical or horizontal it also adds very little to the size or weight of the tablet i absolutely recommend it\",\"a great choice for a good looking and durable case to protect the new fire tablet over the years i ve tried a variety of cases for the various models of kindly and fire tablet that i ve purchased from amazon while i ve found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive i found myself coming back to amazon s own product when i purchased one of

model with case since it was first purchased i ll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet i m very satisfied with it\",\"good looking and works well good looking and works well if you re having trouble standing it up vertically or horizontally check out amazon s video link below my only slight quibble is that i find the fire slippery it s fallen out of my hand and i was hoping this case might have more of a grip material\",\"beautiful and functional originally got the walnut cover with my oasis it s very nice and i would describe it as a sued material for me the walnut cover didn t age well lots of scratching which is necessarily a bad thing but it also seemed to darker a bit which made it a bit dirty the merit cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better after some months of use it looks as good today as when i first bought it oasis covers in general are very functional the nd battery in the cover is genius since i found i really like reading my oasis without the cover i love the easy on off design of the case\",\"great protection and looks great all new amazon fire tablet case th generation release charcoal blackperfect fit i really like the case s simple clean design that lets you sit the tablet vertical and horizontal\",\"not crazy about this th as a kindly case this works but it s got a few too many negatives to the good it s nice and thick meaning it gives good protection and your kindly snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my dx s magnetic case meaning your kindly won t fall out if you tip it too far however i hate the flap this has for dropping it up maybe i was spoiled by my last kindly s case but i had one of the magnetic origami ones and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the kindly up on either of the long sides this one s flap isn t magnetic and it s just one diagonal fold which makes gives far less support the thing tips over or collapses more than i d like it to and if i want to read in landscape orientation i e the long sides go left to right rather than up and down the top and bottom aren t interchangeable that wouldn t normally be a problem but there s a camera on the back of the kindly and the case has a hole for it the problem is there s only one hole which means there s a right way and a wrong way to put the kindly into it like i said none of this would normally be a problem except i sometimes use it while it s charging and my outlet is on the left side of the bed naturally the stand puts the usb thing on the right side of the kindly assuming i don t want to cover the camera i can either prop it up while i read or let it charge while i read but not both i ll probably order a longer usb cable but the one the kindly comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side i wish they d punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the kindly fits it s got a canvass sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case read more\",\"five stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no very sturdy\",\"great case one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i am extremely pleased with this case though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the kindly from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the kindly happens to fall on its face this is a great buy and i highly recommend if you want to keep your kindly safe from harm\",\"does the job but too expensive very protective case but highly over priced piece of molded foam\",\"great protection for my device this is my second fire and case i love both even though i have not dropped my device i feel confident with the thick foam surrounding it would survive if i did\",\"the case itself is amazing it looks good one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i own the merit cover since it came with my kindly oasis after paying near for device and original cover i was hoping replacements would eventually come out so when they did i saw the price tag and immediately became saddened this was probably already in the works but it was an idea i submitted to amazon when i made my original purchase the price is simply outrageous the case itself is amazing it looks good smells good and feels good but i can t afford this\",\"excellent product i bought this along with a fire tablet i purchased for my year old fits great and does the job well as she has already dropped the tablet a few times i would recommend this for anyone buying a fire tablet for their kids\",\"there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn t stand up one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no while this case fits a th gen fire perfectly there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn t stand up on it s own for viewing returning to try another style\",\"worth it to buy the cover while a great idea to make the cover self standing it s annoying that it s floppy when not in use i bought the cover because my first kindly didn t have a cover and often got left on wearing down the battery my second kindly cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device so i wanted that feature on my third kindly even though i think it s over priced i like the convenience my other cover was black which often got lost on dark surfaces this time i got the denim blue so it s much easier to find from a distance\",\"i liked the case but unfortunately i purchased the wrong one i liked the case but unfortunately i purchased the wrong one for my kindly my fault amazon as usual there was no problem getting a refund\",\"it was recommended on the tablet page i bought this case at the same time i bought a new fire tablet during prime days it was recommended on the tablet page so i thought i was getting the right case well it doesn t fit not by a long shot then i realized the case was for a new fire for like mine but th generation not th since it does not fit i now have to return it and at my expense arg i can t even exchange it for a new one because apparently amazon does not make this case for the th generation fire yet you update one of your products then release it but you don t put out a case for it at the same time with amazon when will you start selling amazon cases for the amazon fire th generation i m not happy with amazon right now and am wondering whether i should keep the tablet if i can t get a case for it that has the vertical stand feature that the amazon case has\",\"my fire hd fits securely in this attractive case when i purchased my kindly fire hd this was the recommended case at checkout i purchased it thinking that an amazon sourced based should work and fit well i m very happy with my choice of this case both with its style look and function the price is much lower than that of the case in which i keep my kindly paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the fire to my match my black kindly fire i chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweet style look in various shades of gray and black it has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers i have used on my paperwhite the inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection it does not have an internal pocket my kindly fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case the case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place whether the case is open or closed the ports for charging the micro port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed when it is closed the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens when the cover is fully open and folded to the back the rear camera lens is covered the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open if you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case you can hold the front cover in your off hand while it is in use as i have a tendency to leave my paperwhite on and run down the battery fairly regularly i appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it\",\"a nice accessory for the fire hd as with other recent fire covers by amazon the cover has a snap in plastic shell that holds the fire securely and will not let it fall out i ve used plastic shells similar to this for years with my singles and kindly fires and none of them has ever slipped out another feature that i look for is auto wake sleep which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed it s a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life since you don t have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover it s also a huge convenience feature other comments all of the fire s ports and controls are on top of the fire which is open on the case the speakers are covered but when the case is opened they re uncovered note that the cover does block the micro sd card port on the side the microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen the front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand it s a nice feature especially for watching videos with the cover folded back on itself the rear camera is blocked to use the camera you ll have to keep the cover open but honestly how often are you going to use the fire s rear camera which at mp is pretty lame\",\"very complimentary to the new fire hd this is an improvement over the origami case we purchased for my husband s old fire he liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me this one has only sections so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation just give the tablet a if you can t get it to stand i don t usually like blue but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly there is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive the outputs are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover i often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases but i had no trouble removing this one when i needed to the only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times overall a very nice classic case\",null],\"marker\":{\"opacity\":0.5,\"size\":5},\"mode\":\"markers+text\",\"name\":\"6_black_new_back\",\"text\":[\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"\",\"6_black_new_back\"],\"textfont\":{\"size\":12},\"x\":[10.484663,10.465506,10.717835,10.80027,10.848289,10.918634,10.916288,10.789255,10.809637,10.95867,10.895791,10.800509,10.5174465,10.295562,10.8259115,10.927238,10.918159,10.690802,10.885563,10.836094,10.315242,10.490853,10.891901,10.42096,10.134758,10.80318,10.974143,10.796455,10.775316,10.39402,10.451472,10.94494,10.855807,10.474154,10.657586,10.995113,10.409535,10.471152,10.4847555,10.886204,11.020831,10.443072,10.520337,10.757025,10.543153,10.855789,10.8736315,10.476888,10.5921545,10.655539,10.980214,10.867192,10.496863,10.922808,10.359238,10.576532,10.832345,11.017168,10.402759,10.476237,10.315968,10.501132,10.684139],\"y\":[2.2322931,2.2616947,2.3092582,2.4913242,2.5061755,2.473687,2.4838972,1.8321701,2.3503685,2.0958214,2.3578408,2.6266737,2.471241,2.2521942,1.9613899,2.4359307,2.481954,2.5908005,2.4241183,1.9578532,2.2455199,2.341115,2.4937184,2.26517,2.2789576,2.2093093,2.3516302,2.6047087,2.6504688,2.4506435,2.2153497,2.4435494,1.9255136,2.364107,1.8432593,2.3941085,2.2022722,2.3650644,2.2860131,2.4694097,2.4213252,2.1983876,2.4392223,2.2080097,2.358468,2.5297656,1.9528949,2.4215913,2.1241164,2.0916674,2.4591172,2.4860127,2.3543136,2.0246737,2.4194732,2.3179815,1.9529202,2.4010353,2.280573,2.3113024,2.2473595,2.2820644,2.3109493],\"type\":\"scattergl\"},{\"hoverinfo\":\"text\",\"hovertext\":[\"download

problem from day one and we have only had this for a few months not worth the money\",\"replacing an even worse remote waste of time remote did not activate nor did it connect to box a poorly designed remote replacing an even worse remote waste of time ordered two items had to pay shipping on both they were both shipped in the same padded envelope why double shipping charges\",\"hold the home key product is what it is if you re like me and moved and have no clue where this little remote ended up this is the one you need to replace it it s exactly the same as the one that came with your fire stick however there are no instructions in the box so if you haven t ordered the replacement yet make a note hold the home key that s all you have to do to pair this controller hold the home key for around seconds and it ll connect you re welcome\",\"works great though and i know i can return if it we are huge fans of the amazon fire stick and my son really wants to play the games with the remote a little price in my opinion works great though and i know i can return if it breaks\",\"if you are trying to replace a non working remote my fire stick non voice activated seemed to be broken fire stick responds to my iphone app but not the remote i was ready to purchase this when i thought to go to settings and add another remote followed the on screen directions and my old remote is back for some reason it just needed to make the hand shake again don t forget to try this before giving up and buying another remote\",\"disappointed update remote worked well for about minutes but now jumps around several spots when using the up down left right buttons i didn t really like using the phone app but will now have to go back to it update i was contacted by customer service and was advised to remove batteries and insert a fresh pair although batteries were brand new to begin with and to plug the firestick to restart it the remote has been working properly since doing this i also used the same batteries i just hope this isn t something that will need to be done frequently\",\"and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this integrated perfectly with our fire tv stick and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family it works great with the fire stick and does not negate the other remote giving us two remote options it even has a headphones jack making it so my husband can watch tv shows with bad language while the kids are in the room this is a great addition\",\"don t buy it don t bother paying for one or getting a replacement it just isn t worth it after so many of these things failed so many customers i thought amazon would come up with a newer better product but they have not yet i have gone through three of these things and after the last one died i contacted customer support about it the guy i spoke to said don t waist your money or your time anymore upload the amazon first app on your tablet or phone it will not fail you it is not an exact duplicate of the remote face but it works quite well with both fire tv and fire stick\",\"decent replacement for something that shouldnt have had to be replaced it blows my mind theres not a class action lawsuit against amazon for their crappy fire tv remote after mine died like every other fire tv owner i refused to buy the same crappy expensive remote only to have it die again i found this cheaper option it works just fine with the newer fire tv it obviously doesnt have the alabama voice command but i never used that anyway\",\"great remote hard to pair all in all i love this remote it s pretty small and find myself constantly digging for it in between the couch cushion my original remote is still functioning but will stop working from time to time i bought a replacement to be prepared for when it died i almost thought i received a doa replacement as it took me several tries to get this to pair up i followed the instructions verbatim several times with no luck even put in brand new batteries just in case the ones provided were dead nothing here is how i paired mine just in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue give these steps a try prior to filing a return if your original is still working remove the batteries so it will go offline make sure replacement remote has new batteries sometimes the ones provided are dead plug the power to your fire box stick this will make it restart plug the power back in to your fire box stick wait for the home screen to load hold down the home button on the replacement remote until it pairs up this now forces the device to pair to the replacement remote as it is the only remote online once it pairs select the new remote from the list done you will notice your old remote is still paired but offline now you can put the batteries back in the old remote and both remote will work simultaneouslyhope this helps anyone having issues with the pairing process cheers\",\"disposable these remote are terrible and basically disposable i m now on my third remote and have yet to own one that has lasted longer than five months my family is not rough on them either but as the touch pad gets the slightest bit dirty from daily handling the remote starts getting glitch and then stops working and gently cleaning them doesn t seem to help terrible design from amazon\",\"doesn t respond to first i ve had this for about months now and in those months i ve switched back and forth from this remote and the tiny remote it came with i lost the tiny remote behind my bed months ago and since i m lazy it s still down there so i ve had to rely on the game controller for everything sad face and that s not a good thing battery life is laughable this controller is never farther than feet from the box and yet i always get the annoying loading connecting dots this cost and for that amount of money it should be connecting to a box that s feet away damn you amazon i still love you tho\",\"overpriced it does the job but is super over priced i feel like they should offer a replacement remote at a better price i could have just spent more and gotten the stick i just think it s ridiculous to spend on a remote the product is fine i m just unhappy with the price\",\"great controller with major problems not recommended at this point in time this is a great controller for our fire tv i purchased of them with two problems but let me first talk about the good the controller works well for most of the games we play on the fire tv it has a long range compared to other controllers ive tried solid at feet and uses wifi direct instead of bluetooth the feel of it is decent not too rubber and none of the buttons d pad or sticks have stuck or given us a problem the microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the fire tv remote now on to the problems its such an issue that im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it the worst problem is the battery life in fact its such a huge problem that im taking off stars because of it this controller eats batteries like nobody business i have tried regular aa batteries both duracell and energies expensive aa batteries both duracell and energies and rechargeable aa batteries ive tried energies apple amazonbasics the controller doesnt drain the batteries completely note that i would understand instead the controller stops working after only a drain i kid you not every set of batteries i have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still battery life left i have tested each set before and after using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter the second problem may not be the controller itself it may be the fire tv but its affecting the controller the controller randomly disconnect not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying i have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update read more\",\"very disappointed remote didn t work did all the troubleshooting to connect sent me a replacement remote that didn t fix it and then when i sent the replacement remote they couldn t find it and charged me anyway very disappointed\",\"amazon fire tv remote sucks i don t know what s wrong with fire tv remote but they tend to malfunction after a while i have no intention of buying another one when the replacement remote breaks again i m done with amazon fire tv and will look for another provider unless amazon gives me a free remote\",\"update no longer works with fire tv update no longer will pair with nd generation first since reset update it did still pair with st generation first i have in another room was working fine with my nd gen until i reset it after having external memory problems original review works and pairs quick with fire tv just no voice search my wife likes her own amazon remote so this works good for us at half the price of the fire tv remote sold here my only concern is how small it is but hopefully that won t be a problem\",\"on my third replacement remote i am now having to order my third remote because it randomly dies for no reason replacing batteries attempting to resynch etc don t work it reaches a point where it just stops functioning on the positive i love that it s bluetooth and i can use it anywhere in the room without having to point it right at the fire box\",\"faulty remote short life span purchased the replacement control because the original stopped working ordered the replacement in november and it also stopped working for no apparent reason i changed the batteries twice with no luck it was great for the three months it lasted however it only lasted months unfortunately my return date expired weeks ago i downloaded the remote app and it consistently losses wifi connectivity home wifi network works perfectly on all my other phone apps\",\"battery draining remote i have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since i purchased it in march after the battery s short life span after the first battery replacement we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller it did not make a difference it still drained the batteries just as quickly i do have the option of using the phone app and i do but what if i m not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv this is very very poor quality product of course it went out of warranty days ago i guess i should have been more mindful of that date i do not recommend this product and i think amazon should extend the warranty coverage it is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn t work\",\"great second remote well what to say this is a replacement remote did i buy it due to one not working note the kids lost it and i wanted another till i could find it parking it was simple hold the home button for around seconds to let the fire stick find it and then boom your all set to go works just like the original that came with it so no worries there\",\"makes games fun not that amazon needs another star review for this remote but damn this is a great remote we don t have and never will have a game console in my house my year old and i have a blast playing cross road and shark evolution on our big screen tv with this remote super great glad i bought it\",\"my voice remote controller posed out purchased my first one with the tv fire box over a year ago and now it is gone purchased a second one but you would think amazon would do a better in taking care of some people having the same problem with them my daughter can control the box from her iphone as another person listed so we may send the order back for refund after it gets here tomorrow i do have two fire sticks as well in the bedrooms and no problems with those\",\"oem remote gave out after months considering replacement voice remote gave out nearly a year after i purchased changed batteries several times and nothing have to rely on phone app for it to function paid for the stick when it was being promoted to prime members now they want for an extra might as well buy another fire stick what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic even with the voice remote feature i still don t think it is worth it amazon should sell the remote for dollars for prime members we shouldn t have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for prime membership and its content to begin with\",\"shouldn t have to settle for a phone app or paying of the entire thing to get another remote shame on you amazon my remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the fire stick put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks then i didn t have time to get to it until the return time was out i tried batteries again cleaning the ports and everything i could think of because i can t get the cheap remote working this fire stick is stuck on the television on which is was originally installed until i pay for a new remote amazon you can do better than this i see that there are many many posts of people like me whose remote just don t work a phone app is nice but shouldn t have to be the only answer besides another remote that costs of the original whole product\",\"nd bad remote second remote stopped working will not work with firestick software on tv very carefully chose home arrows has a mind of it s own had to plug so that it wouldn t register device i did not choose that selection bad device kept defaulting to video game or going to sleep options window however none would select going to look for another service\",\"great game controller for fire tv this is my second one and it is great it can be used as a remote also it was easy to pair with my fire tv i received my first one when i purchased the gaming edition of fire tv and i liked it so much that i bought a second one for my son he is a gamer and he was very happy with it i would recommend this product for anyone who is a gamer there are many more games available for the fire tv and they play flawless on the fire

landed on the car mat an all of the glue section was instantly covered in dirt washed it off with cool water only let air dry and it won t stick back on it s supposed to be mashable and re usable don t waste your money on this piece of trash i expected it to last a lot longer than two months\",\"don t waste time with other screen protectors buy this one i tried other screen protectors that claimed would work with the multiple cameras on the fire phone nah the joshi anti glare protector is the only one that lives up to the claim money finally well spent\",\"only one i have found to work on the fire phone finally a protector that works on the fire phone it is as advertised probably the easiest one i have put on i have put screen protectors on several phones and tablets no bubbles but the best part is that this one actually works on the fire phone this is the third screen protector i have tried the first one was glaze temper glass this is when i found out about the issue with the sensors on the phone you can not cover them if you want the phone to work properly per monday the second one was mr shield for the fire phone although the illustration showed cut outs for of the sensors what was shipped had no cut outs for the sensors the joshi has cut outs for the sensors though it is a little price it was well worth the money monday was very helpful in finally getting me to this protector\",\"a piece of plastic this was a complete waste of i read reviews and thought the product was better than a thin piece of sticky plastic lasted about one week and my husband is not a frequent user of his cellphone either so for someone who carries cell with them and uses daily will probably last a day or so\",\"great screen protector no bubble great for kids easy to install screen protector no bubbles fits just right on fire phone will not disrupt most cases or change overall phone dimensions great item if you are letting your kid grandis use or play with your phone this item will not disrupt the dynamic perspective or front facing cameras very good anti glare properties can notice a large difference\",\"highly recommended i ve purchased two of these screen protectors at att for my fire phones both have performed perfectly for me unlike some reviewers experience the screens on my phones don t look fuzzy when the orientation of the phone is changed the edges do not collect lint from my pockets and the protector does not keep the case from fitting the phone here s what the protector does do it keeps my screens from collecting fingerprints or skin oil i don t know about the ease of application because for both my purchases the employee at att attached the protectors for me i don t have the steadfast hands watching them it looked quite easy to do there are no bubbles at all and no more screen glare reflections i haven t had to remove replace or clean the protectors except for wiping off the surface just to be sure it s clean because the protector doesn t show any dirt or oil\",\"accessories that complement my device fits greatly with the device and easy to use the fabric makes it look cool\",\"perfect fit super easy application zero bubbles so far it is working great fits under my kayscase armor box perfectly some reviews complain about the adhesive but that remains to be seen so far for me obviously hoping that will not be the case the touch effect on my screen has not diminished one bit\",\"not a long lasting product i got my kindly a few years ago and barely used it recently i discovered it again and have been using it daily always in a hard protective case as it has been from day yesterday i opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked seemingly for no apparent reason no extreme temperatures dropping pressure etc a quick google search revealed this is a common problem especially for my model which made me think amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw not a chance though despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative i spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product not sure it is worth the investment again thinking it is better to stick to reading on my ipad which is equipped with indestructible gorilla glass bottom line do not buy a kindly if you want a lasting product\",\"updated downgraded update july i m reducing my rating to one star because all of a sudden this morning the screen protector just quit adhering to the screen it falls off completely and if you do get it in place within five minutes it s slipping again and huge bubbles form i have never had a problem with a joshi product before and i am very surprised by this at this price there is no excuse for the poor longevity of this product and i would never ever buy one again nor would i advise anybody to spend the money on this product to begin with original review follows in all its irony except for the whining about the price at the time that i still stand by superb screen protector the best you can buy ridiculous price joshi products have been the stress reliever i ve relied on when it comes to tablets and phone screen save installation with their bubble proof installation and performance but in this particular case i think the price i paid was twice what it was worth so now the stress is back\",\"joshi s screen protectors are so good i choose my devices in part by whether they make them for them i like joshi s anti glare screen protectors so much that the fact that there is one available for the fire phone is part of why i bought a fire phone i ve had these screen protectors on multiple pads and ipod touches over the years and they re the st thing i buy for any device i own particularly those with shiny screens i love that you don t have to worry about if you don t get them on right the first time you can just pull them off and try again i love that when they get dirty you just remove it from the gadget and run it under water to clean it off and then put it back on your device the fire phone does have a smaller been than the pads and ipod touches i ve used with other joshi anti glare protectors but there seems to be just enough that the protector stays on in case you don t understand how joshi s screen protectors work the only sticky part on them is where it covers the been the non screen part of your device i also hate shiny screens and these protectors make devices usable which wouldn t work for me otherwise so glad the anti glare joshi protector is available for the fire phone for some other amazon devices you can only get the regular joshi screen protector i ve used this with the default amazon cases without problem both the leather one and the polyurethane one i just put the screen protector on first and then the case\",\"secondly it is really soft actually thus it will be scratched easily by anything near your cellphone such as keys or this one really does not have bubble problems yes because the screen part is actually thinner than side part thus it is actually floating above the screen while it cause a problem that the touch screen is not as sensitive than in the previous time secondly it is really soft actually thus it will be scratched easily by anything near your cellphone such as keys or coins i would like to say that design is okay but it is not satisfactory as a screen protector\",\"for the love of god do not buy this for the love of god do not buy this thought it was great at first since it didn t add any size to the phone given that it sticks to the face well at least its supposed to lasted three days and came of the phone and now can t do anything with it since

that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mid it s pretty

minutes to an hour at a time br br audio i m not a complete audiophile but i do like the occasional nice set of headphones if you re thinking these are a nice set of headphones then don t even think about ordering br i guess i would say they re pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down br one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume br i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mid it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones br br looks i love the black look angle free cord is very nice to have and i also found it interesting how the section above the controls are the regular thin cables to make it lighter when dangling read

found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i bought these for a couple of reasons first i wanted an earned that was not designed as noise cancelling i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them apparently a lot of people are under the assumption that these are supposed to be noise cancelling or something which they are not they are simple earbuds i hate not being able to hear what is going on around me and don t feel safe in public using headphones that block everything else out these are designed just like the old style earbuds that you stick in your ears but they are more comfortable maybe i have small ears or something but they could never fall out or dislodge from my ears they don t cancel the outside noise but they sit in my ears exactly as they are supposed to so the sound travels right into my ears second i really like the magnets and angle free aspects of the headphones i use headphones while i work and the magnets allow me to hang the headphones easily when i am finished with them the flat cord and magnets also mean the headphones never really angle when you put them in a bag or wherever awesome design finally the sound i get out of these seems pretty average i would compare them to the stock apple iphone earbuds or a set of sony earbuds nothing special they are only and a lot of that is the fact these were just released and that you are paying for the design as far as magnets in the ear buds and the nice flat cable don t expect them to perform like headphones because they aren t designed to perform like that they are just a nice simple set of earbuds that will sound good to most people the magnets and angle free cord are awesome and they are really quite comfortable read more\",\"i would say these are the go to

was this review helpful to you yes no while i ve purchased items from amazon for years i rarely write reviews i felt compelled to write one because although there are only a few reviews at this point i have never seen such a good product get such bad reviews i m hoping as more people purchase these the star rating will be more accurate of the product itself i ll address the three biggest complaints i ve read from others sound quality i think these headphones sound great i ve never owned an expensive pair so i m not able to compare them to higher end offerings but i ve owned dozens of cheap and mid range headphones in the range i m not an audiophile or a musician so if i m missing something that should be coming through but isn t i m fine with my ignorance i would say they re slightly better than apple s buds which i liked very much and used for years most recently using their redesigned ones for about a year there s no tiny listening through a can sound that s all too common with headphones in this price range as far as people saying they don t compare to apple s buds well i don t know maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of apple s buds that are amazing but compared to the regular earpods i think amazon s headphones actually sound a bit better they provide a nice full sound and represent highs lows and mid equally well mainly listening to metal fit and feel some people have complained about these falling or feeling like they re going to fall out of their ears there s some validity to this although obviously it depends on your specific ears i don t feel like they re going to fall out at all but if i give the cord a tug they don t stay as secure as my apple buds read more\",\"i hate having to shove headphones into my brain to use them i bought

my original black cover had shown signs of wear due to repeatedly falling asleep with it folded back i was much more careful with the merit and it showed more signs after a shorter period of time and the flak thing along the sides looks and feels just cheap and for i would expect real leather so i switched back to my original black cover and i m just letting it age with the device i guess the plus side is that the merit made me like the black cover more but the downside is it cost to do so ridiculous as stated in the title i love my oasis i ve had it for about six months and with the exception of the defective first one i received which was promptly replaced i haven t had a problem out of it i had gotten the black cover because black is my default choice always however a couple of months ago i had gotten a screen protector and skin for the oasis and i just wasn t feeling the black cover anymore i had considered the merit i think the walnut would feel nicer to the touch but i despise brown leather so i gave in after much consideration and ordered it it didn t arrive with the bundle of things that it was supposedly shipped with but after a quick call to customer service i had a new tracking number it finally arrived today i am disappointed to say that i don t love it it smells funny as i done remember my original doing the color is fuller than in the picture maybe my

overall very good besides the missing app functionality check compatibility before purchasing it does exactly what i want it to\",\"fantastic tablet for the price let me start by saying i purchased this item from my local best buy store for the same price here on amazon plus tax but i feel that more people read amazon reviews so i wanted to leave my review here now i didn t expect this to be an amazing tablet but people were generally saying it was happy enough i wanted a media tablet something i could use late at night to watch youtube videos or an episode of my favorite show while laying in bed i also like it for online shopping so i don t have to hold a laptop but am not looking at my phone screen pros tablet exceeded my expectations it s great for media i use this more than my phone and my laptop now it s happy i was able to complete my homework for online classes watch videos from cnn and other tasks without too much struggle can be a general purpose tablet heed my warning doing the following may void your warranty with amazon i m not sure but i installed the google play store on my fire hd and now have access to a huge selection of apps i decided to do this after finding there was no good youtube app from amazon s app store because fire os is basically android with a heavy skin on it everything runs perfectly as you can see from the pictures sound is fantastic did i say that loud enough yes they are still tablet speakers no they won t fill your whole room with bumping bass but my josh these are some good tablet speakers better than my smartphone laptop and ipad what i m trying to say is the speakers are way better than the price point would suggest bravo amazon cons ram is lacking doesn t excel in multitasking drops tasks while you re away even if it was the last thing you were doing it does this randomly however and it s not always a problem read more\",\"great product makes for a great alarm and reminder device i own dots and the tap use them all\",\"accessories that complement my device fits greatly with the device and easy to use the fabric makes it look cool\",\"five stars super sturdy and easy for little hands to hold\",\"great works great but wants you to buy subscription to get some music you may like just found out it supports dish network\",\"it works great nice picture no problem looking it up worked right away my son let me try the apple it kept stalling right in the middle out and had to wait for it to reboot i m glad im glad i purchased the amazon fire tv thank you\",\"great device but needs an sd card slot just spent a few hours with my first and am quite impressed setup is incredibly easy the voice commands work amazingly well and everything loads quickly the lack of storage is a major issue if you are planning on using it for gaming only gb s of space is usable which can be filled quite quickly by games that push past gb a piece on the plus side wired xbox controllers workalso this would be a great device for someone who is not tech savvy there is a really nice instructional animation that loads the first time you power on the device and the voice commands make finding content very easy for parents there are parental controls and an option to block all in app purchases this is a godsend if you have kids edit there are dozens of reviews from people who don t even have a first look for the verified purchase logo on reviews if it doesn t appear ignore that review as they don t have any experience with the device\",\"i love this handheld device especially all the items available for it games books music etc glad i bought it thanks for having it available\",\"it doesn t work one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no my adaptor doesn t work maybe i m doing something wrong but there are no instructions it looks pretty simple so it just simply doesn t work\",\"great camera for a beginner camera was perfect for my daughter she s in yearbook at school and fell in love with it\",\"has a lot of apps built in i really liked this tablet got it for my nephew who just turned has many built in kid rated apps which keeps him entertained the bumper is a bonus in case he drops it too what i also like is that it had another mode to switch to in case an adult wanted to use it too\",\"help desk is a joke if you do not have wifi connection my device says i am connected with excellent score the airplane mode is off but still no real connection try using the online help with connection course they do not publish a telephone number thus it is worthless\",\"no problems so far to date it s working fine i m hoping that it continues to work it s usually not the charger that goes bad for me though it s the cord\",\"five stars great product and really protects the tablet\",\"five stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no very sturdy\",\"kf dx is ok do homework on prime download before you buy people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no updated one year in this review is for the the no ad gb wifi only dx i use a galaxy s android smartphone so the dx is for media web surfing offline viewing for travel since i had already been using amazon prime and prime music it was a no brainer for me to use the dx to fill the role of media web surfing on a tablet be informed about the download limitations to this device amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would be purchasers make a more informed opinion this wasn t as obvious as it should have been when i ordered mine so they re listening which is good be aware that their most popular prime content may not be available to download and save to your dx you can save certain videos to your dx but you won t know which ones until you buy an dx and try it out edited you can now see a list of prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device that s an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable prime content for amazon i was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you d like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the dx also not the case so again i bought the larger capacity dx under this assumption that was dumb on my part as it turns out because you re not limited by storage capacity you re limited the number of downloads you can have on your device kids content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation but most people never will read more\",\"it has so many uses and performs well last christmas i gave my nephew a fire stick which he loved in the meantime i purchased an amazon tap for myself since he likes gadgets i knew he would want one so i purchased it for him\",\"don t buy it don t bother paying for one or getting a replacement it just isn t worth it after so many of these things failed so many customers i thought amazon would come up with a newer better product but they have not yet i have gone through three of these things and after the last one died i contacted customer support about it the guy i spoke to said don t waist your money or your time anymore upload the amazon first app on your tablet or phone it will not fail you it is not an exact duplicate of the remote face but it works quite well with both fire tv and fire stick\",\"perfect for the little ones great sturdy case perfect for my three year old\",\"it never worked i m thinking this must of been a fluke it never worked had to return item but received full refund\",\"great bought for my husband for christmas and i have to admit that i use it much more than he does i love this product even though it has been updated with newer versions i like to have something with just books easy to use screen is easy to read battery life long i use it at the beach and for travel nice to have\",\"why buy new refurbished is tops i purposely waited almost months before leaving a review i wanted to see if any issues developed before leaving feedback i was not disappointed the refurbished fire arrived in perfect condition no scratches or wear i purchased a screen cover immediately to insure it would remain in good shape after months it works like a champ no issues whatsoever very pleased and would not hesitate purchasing refurbished item again amazon has always treated me superb with any issues i might have with orders or returns\",\"great product no issues at all wish it were water proof my kids and family love it\",\"doesn t respond to first i ve had this for about months now and in those months i ve switched back and forth from this remote and the tiny remote it came with i lost the tiny remote behind my bed months ago and since i m lazy it s still down there so i ve had to rely on the game controller for everything sad face and that s not a good thing battery life is laughable this controller is never farther than feet from the box and yet i always get the annoying loading connecting dots this cost and for that amount of money it should be connecting to a box that s feet away damn you amazon i still love you tho\",\"so far i love it has features even my fire hd doesn t have i ve had this a week now i also have a kindly fire hd i have had for about a year with the case on the fire hd is heavy i love the hd and never leave home with out it but many times i wish i could just slip my books in my pocket and run i go a lot of places on the run take others places where i wait for them to shop or what ever and there is not wifi to play on my fire hd i just want to read my reading time has come up from one book a year to books a year and now my reading will go up even more this was the perfect answer so feather light it is incredible it is taking me a bit to not swine the screen to turn a page and get used to the lay out and use of the various buttons but after an hour i had read the built in owners manual learned the ins and outs of the buttons and had it set up it connected to my wifi instantly the on screen key board has taken a bit to get used to but once you use it a few times you can do it pretty fast i wondered how all my content library of books would be transferred from my fire hd to this device to my pleasant surprise after connecting to my wi fi the next time i looked at the home menu my entire library of over books was there archived i just click a title and it down loads in seconds i honestly can t tell the difference between the print on this and the print on my fire hd pixel wise my eyes can t differentiate a thing i love the texture look of a page from a book look the no glare is amazing there are times and places i can t read or see the screen on my fire hd and this just runs circles around the reading in bright light yes read more\",\"losses the network overnight every night i like the box but i m on a wired network and overnight it losses the connection so the next day i have to plug the fire tv box and let it reboot to find the network again i called customer service and they said they would look into it and get back well they never got back to me and it has been over two weeks i like it when it works but i hate having to reboot the thing every time i want to watch it\",\"solid we re early in the stages of home sharpness but this is a good start\",\"excellent device this is a device that works as advertised it is simple and quick to set up but requires a call to the internet provider in order to obtain the necessary password since i never watch any network tv except fox having movies available at all times is very satisfying\",\"parents with young kids this is worth it we have always used samsung tablets and so this took a little while adjusting how to navigate so far we have been using this for about a week and it does take some time to set up you will need to go through and make sure all the settings are correct for your kid and this will take some time i think the effort is worth it this review is specifically for the kids edition tablet the tablet the tablet itself is a good size for my almost yr old it is not heavy and seems to be the right size for him to handle the protective case has definitely done its job because we have already had a couple of incidents update this has been thrown against a wall and landed on tile and no cracks or breaks the viewing quality is decent otherwise it is what you would expect from a tablet i have not had another fire before so i can only compare this to a samsung galaxy and so far it is what i would expect from a tablet of this class the features the real reason for the purchase is it worth it yes definitelypreviously we had been sharing our tablet and our phones with our little one but more and more he would get into content he should not be getting into everything from buying stuff and watching content not appropriate for his age ie our downloads of deadpool and logan because these look like superheroes but they are not the appropriate ones for kids side note i loved how they portrayed deadpool and logan we are big comic fans and they finally got their characters right i have even deleted youtube from our tablets and hidden the app in our phones in files so that he can t get at them but this tablet has been a game changer it has great parental controls read more\",\"this fire tablet is much better than the last one please improve the freetime experience we got this the day it came out i have a four year old daughter and she loves it we have an ipad for her but it was getting very expensive because so many of the games have buttons that you can click which then tell you about things you need to buy and she would have to have them this tablet restricts all in app purchasing yay we tried the older version of this tablet but it kept freezing and did not perform well but so far this one works well i have two requests to amazon and i am hoping that someone from amazon reads my review so they can make this change please change amazon freetime so that it puts the story apps that are under apps into the books sections there are many wonderful stories that are read out loud but they are in the apps section instead of the books section so then when i restrict her tablet to books only she can t access them i would love it so much if you they would fix this a few examples of the stories she can t access when i restrict her to books because they are considers apps are the following night night charlie brown s the berenstain bears and dino store story the other recommendation i have is to please hide from view the activities that are restricted as it is now she can see all the apps but gets an error message when she selects them i really like this product and i think it so great for children it just needs a few little improvements to the freetime interface\",\"it s wonderful i never give stars because there is nothing in life that is perfect and you really don t know if there s a problem until you ve used something for several months this kindly meets all of my expectations and seems to be working just great\",\"good but need some improvements i would give it a star review if it didn t keep having recurring issues with wired ethernet connection for some reason i have to keep taking out the ethernet cable and plugging it back in the device in order for it to recognize the wired connection now the funny thing is that the wifi connection works fine the reason that is funny or ironic is that typically that is where most devices have an issue when it comes to internet connection the reason i choose being wired in is because i want fast data transfer now the fire works well with everything else very smooth and the interface is well laid out\",\"what about the amazon cloud player i assumed based on the product description that access to songs meant that i could play my own songs on the cloud that i also pay amazon a couple hundred dollars a year for why not a cloud player app for crying out loud if i m mistaken and i can access my cloud music i sure appreciate it if somebody could tell me how that s why i bought it i might return it because i can already get everything by amazon s own content through other means kind of a drag that i can t play my amazon purchased music through my expensive home theater i couldn t care less about viewing my amazon cloud photos on my home theater\",\"simply gorgeous i previously owned an asks infinity with inch screen until it died on vacation and i grabbed the smaller gb fire during the one day sale i could not get used to the small screen or lack of storage so here i am with the new inch fire if you liked your fire you will love this the gb is sufficient itself for downloading tons of books music and a couple of movies and games but when you pair that with the ability at last to use a memory card and it s about time amazon makes a version that can do this the storage is enough for even most power users set up is a breeze just follow the onscreen instructions within minutes out of the box i was surfing the web checking my email and posting on facebook after charging the battery to full i streamed a one hour tv show from netflix and when i checked afterwards the battery was still at percent i am writing this review on it right now if you have prime you can download a movie to watch later without needing your wifi which is a big plus for me as we are in storm season here so when the power goes out i can at least watch a movie\",\"keeps getting better especially for comic readers this is my th kindly fire i also have the first generation an dx and the new the first thing that impresses is how thin and light this new model is despite being the largest fire to date i love the more narrow widescreen design of the screen perfect for watching videos and reading books in portrait mode anyway before i get carried away pushing ill just list my pros and one or two cons to make this easier to read and save time pros wide screen design is perfect for videos and allows more text on a page for books the stereo speakers sound incredible even better than the previous dx modelfor comic book readers comics purchased from amazon now utilize the active panel reading mode from comixology i was wondering when amazon was going to incorporate this feature for their comics finally battery life seems to be similar to my dx but im happy with that considering the larger screen and thickness of the device considerably faster response time across the board finally we can add a micro sd card to expand storage capacity yay the camera takes photos that are much better quality than previous firecons would have preferred a rubberized back and case the glossy finish is a fingerprint magnet also still deciding on the new software layout maybe its because im so familiar with the old fire os but lets just say im not blown away be the design so far\",\"great beach reader i have the kindly fire but was frustrated when taking it to the beach this model is easy to read on the beach and was easy to set up you can t tell that it s refurbished it looks brand new\",\"updated review after months i am updating my review from two months ago my initial review for the sling cover was based on first impressions after just receiving it today i have been using the tap and sling daily for over the last two months and i felt like i needed to modify my review i originally did not recommend this product but after living with it and growing to like it i am changing my recommendation the truth is the base and top feel more protected than the appearance would have you believe i have dropped it a couple times and it was protected by the sling i think the rubber absorbs most of the force of the fall also it has been sat into a paddle and the bottom is protected by the rubber sling i initially was upset by the sling preventing me from charging on the charging dock but it isn t as big of a problem as i thought it would be i just pull off the bottom of the sling and charge it leaving the top of the sling on easy off and easy back on after my only real lingering complaint would be the price for essentially a thin piece of rubber wrapping the top and bottom still seems a little excessive i am increasing my stars by one really the price is the only thing keeping this from a star for me i have come to really like the sling i have also bought a cheap pouch to throw it into while transporting it that has eased my concerns about keeping it clean safe while throwing it into a work bag my original is below overall i would and have recommended the sling to protect the tap received the tap and the sling cover in the last hours read more\",\"excellent product i bought this along with a fire tablet i purchased for my year old fits great and does the job well as she has already dropped the tablet a few times i would recommend this for anyone buying a fire tablet for their kids\",\"new kindly fire dx would not let me register when i received my new kindly i tried several times to set it up it would not work i called service and worked with them several times to get it to work and finally your representative said the kindly had problems and i should just mail it back\",\"i was pretty summed out that a refurbished product of their own bought a refurbished kindly and literally after one month of owning it the device started to freeze i had to reboot it multiple times and then it would start working went on a trip and it worked as it should but as soon as i returned the battery died and i charged it over night and the next morning the screen was frozen with the character reading a book under a tree i tried all reporting methods seconds seconds minute and nothing called customer service and was on the phone for an hour eventually they said that they could only give me off the next purchase of a new kindly i was pretty summed out that a refurbished product of their own was not backed by them i ended up buying a new kindly with the discount they gave me but should have just went with a new one to begin with since i ended up spending the same amount of money and had way more of a headache to deal with now i have to figure out what to do with this new kindly paper weight that i have\",\"it is a pretty large charger though and doesn t fit in the kindly very expensive charger i think the kindly should come with it as does all other tablets including the fire which is way cheaper and includes the charger for just it is a pretty large charger though and doesn t fit in the kindly box with the kindly at all\",\"greatest thing ever we love this speaker for listening to music the weather news or just anything it is super portable and even has a hands free option so it is really like a mini echo\",\"it s always good to buy on sale the reason i purchased this style of kindly it s small just like a paperback book and very portable so far so good i m enjoying every minute of use the os is very friendly user driven easy to navigate shopping apps and books is very easy the user interface takes a bit to get use too if you are use to using tablets with ios windows or android there is a very short learning curve the one aspect i like is the ability to group your items games books and the ability to make a new group keeps the confusion down the clarity and speed of the kindly is great i m very impressed by it s sharp image i only use a wi fi connection so the movies stream without a problem well worth the purchase on sale\",\"to all the people saying it s too dark it s to all the people saying it s too dark it s literally the same screen as the older devices look at comparison if anything the new kindly on right is lighter than the previous device\",\"excellent love it my amazon prime movies come in crystal clear and fast the voice search really works very well netflix resolution is excellent much better than what the netflix app on my lg flatscreen tv delivers the alex app delivers excellent video i haven t tried the music yet having used this for a little over a week now my next step is to buy two more for each tv in the house and give away my apple tv it simply does everything so much better most satisfied highly recommend will post an update if i have anything further to add but i will say this go get one really worth the price\",\"worth every penny if you have prime this is the best thing you can buy\",\"replacement cover from amazon under warranty the case that came with my oasis had an edge that wasn t quite glued down amazon replaced it without difficulty and the new case is flawless it detached from the oasis quickly and easily i pull the kindly off when i m holding it one handed and pop it right back in when finished my only complain which is a minor one is that the felt inside cover can collect dust and dirt but i don t know that there s a better way to construct it since the interior needs to be soft when it rests against the screen in any case it s a brilliant bit of kit and i would buy another in an instant were anything to happen to the one i have now\",\"looks new the refurbished kindly looks brand new i wouldn t even know that it was used the only down side was that when i opened up the package the kindly was already on\",\"i am and the only problem i have with my kindly is that it seems to have granted itself to my hand i am having trouble putting it down to do things like clean the house do dishes wash clothes it works great and i really love the game plants vs zombies i love that it came with the wall charger\",\"five stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no perfect for my year old son he is so rough on things and this protects his kindly well\",\"five stars nice controller\",\"w or v a q what s the difference between a amazon w usb official oem charger and power supply and a v a ma usb port power supply ul listed calling it a w charger rather than a v a charger is a distinction without a difference\",\"great color one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i replaced the brown sued cover that came with my kindly because i d dropped it a couple of times and it had problems staying connected it wouldn t charge so it was pretty much useless i went with the leather cover because the sued cover while nice to touch did get worn i had one on my old kindly paper white so i decided a leather cover would be better the color is as lovely as a glass of merit and stays connected so far i love using this new kindly oasis because it s so much lighter than my old paper white\",\"amazing for kids perfect got this in addition to the new gb tablet when it was released and my son loves it and if it drops it is well protected thanks amazon\",\"my kindly fired received my kindly and it was in good shape package not damaged i see the difference with the kindly fire hd compared to dx cause their isn t any one has camera and the other didn t i plan on keeping my kindly fire hd thanks amazon i love it\",\"kf dx is ok do homework on prime download before you buy updated one year in this review is

at a good price and a fast delivery that you can count on you can not go wrongthank you\",\"wonderful very useful for those who enjoy reading and inspiring those who do not have a habit of reading needed for anyone not yet\",\"customer service i m stunned at how bad it was i purchase almost everything with the exception of food from amazon i have been a prime member since the inception of the program without exception i have always received excellent customer service until now i m having difficulty with my fire tv connecting to my wifi last saturday i spent approximately hours maybe troubleshooting with two women tech on the phone mary who i was passed to from the first tech because of her expertise said she thought it wasn t just a problem unique to me and asked me if she could call me back on sunday after researching the problem i had no problem with that no call on sunday so i called on monday much to my surprise there was no record of my call attached to my file the rep was confused as to whether i was talking about fire wire or fire tv so i was first sent to a different department finally i got through that fire wire was not the same as fire tv and i was transferred back to digital we went through the same troubleshooting taking up a lot of my time i was willing to do it until we were going around in circles and my phone was running out of juice the gentleman asked me if he could research and call me later in the day no call it s tuesday still no call it really pains me to have to say anything negative about amazon s customer service as it has never been less than excellent in the past i ve noticed i haven t gotten a survey as i usually do after a customer service call whoever amazon has farmed out their digital customer service to will ruin their excellent customer service reputation and they will lose sales because of it i m going to wager a bet that there is no record of the hours of my time on the phone trying to solve a problem and no record of two promises to call me back i would have had more respect for these reps if i had received a call saying they were sorry but they weren t able to come up with a solution for me i m hoping amazon has kept a record of my past reviews and will review my account and see just how much i ve spent over the years as a loyal customer i m very disappointed that i had to write this review and i m hoping someone who can change things reads this and saves amazon s reputation i can t be the only one receiving this kind of treatment it s obvious that the people who are tech for fire tv are not the same tech that i ve dealt with in the past in fact i don t think they are even in the same country what a pity\",\"good good but not overall as capable or comprehensive as i was hoping will continue to explore capabilities and apps\",\"no big improvement in the model review updated september as a background i am a retired information systems professional and i am writing this review from the perspective of being a long time kindly user i have all the current e readers and fire devices from amazon including the basic kindly the and new paperwhite the fire hd fire hd fire dx and fire dx this review is for the all new kindly paperwhite the attached picture shows the kindly on the left and the new kindly on the right here is the summary of my initial impressions of the model versus the model i am somewhat disappointed in the version as there is not a huge improvement over last years model the paperwhite made many improvements from its original first generation model to its second generation model especially in the display and processor area the model came with gb storage a wonderful display a great battery and was the e book workhouse the second generation model changed by only increasing storage to gb the third generation model increased the display resolution but reduced the battery life slightly what comes in the box a paperwhite device a quick start guide and a short usb cord amazon still does not supply a power adapter size its the same identical size as the older paperwhites the weight has been reduced slightly from to ounces a fraction of an ounce most likely because of a smaller battery the good news is that all cases that fit the other paperwhites will fit the version display the resolution has been bumped up to ppi equivalent to the voyage read

your feedback we re glad you re enjoying your kindly fire hd and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience we wanted to answer your question about storage hd content is much larger than sd content which is why kindly fire hd starts at gb on average a minute hd movie is gb and a minute hd tv episode is gb with your gb kindly fire hd you can have up to hd movies or hd tv episodes this number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device we hope this information helps thanks the kindly team\",\"very responsive and intuitive this item was very easy to use from the very beginning and was very responsive to my request and commands i like the fact that you can also add other items to work with it\",\"should have bought one years ago love it i purchased this as i have had audible for quite some time now and thought it would be easier just to get the amazon brand for downloading from kindleprime audible and even the endless books for being a prime member and it is i have a reader also thought that was all i would ever need now wishing i would have just purchased this in the beginning being a prime member and all of the new neat things amazon is coming up with this is just way better and easier for me no doubt about it i do like all the features it has and the tech help available when you have issues if you are soon behind in the tech world as i am next kindly fire i purchase will be the gb though kind of just thought try it on for size so to speak had no idea i would truly like it so much very pleased with this purchase seems well made and durable although the kid case i purchased to go with it might be why it feels as such lol\",\"mine has problems connecting to wifi the customer care and the technical team are highly incapable of handling the case they even lost the log files i sent them multiple times they will not update you the status and it s a pure waste of my money and time\",\"definitely better than the previous generation people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no just got mine right now looks the same as the previous generation except for the kindly logo it s black this time feels a little heavier the screen is a little warmer toned than the previous one but the resolution is so much better the ppi are definitely obvious and the new font is worth the money totally recommend it for a book lover i ll give it stars instead of because i am used to a cooler screen but i m sure i ll get used to this one soon too\",\"a piece of plastic this was a complete waste of i read reviews and thought the product was better than a thin piece of sticky plastic lasted about one week and my husband is not a frequent user of his cellphone either so for someone who carries cell with them and uses daily will probably last a day or so\",\"yes you can download apps like kidsyou tube i feel like a lot of the bad reviews are from people who do not know what they are doing or don t fully understand how to use the tablet to its full potential this tablet does allow you download any app that you would find on the play store because of the parental features you have to first download them on your parent profile first i love that about this tablet also i can block the camera and web browser so my child can t access that either i can put a pass code on pretty much everything like profiles wifi access settings etc it s really easy to set up and it came almost fully charged so i had plenty of time download what i wanted for my daughter and set it all up before i had to put it on the charger it does however take a bit long to complete charge to but no big deal this is a great tablet so far and we are thoroughly enjoying it\",\"brilliant this is an awesome product i had received a kindly paperwhite as a christmas gift and it has since become an indispensable part of my daily life the fit and finish of that product is top notch and so i was eager to see if this one matches the quality i have come to expect from amazon short answer it does everything works perfectly and i still have trouble believing that they packed this much awesomeness into such a small box having had bad experiences with streaming video in the past i was a little wary about trying this but i needn t have worried browsing menus is fast the voice search works great and watching movies is flawless a nice touch is all of the detailed help videos which are included as the first thing you see after you set up the device even setup is easy fast and fun hook it up to the tv plug it in enter network password wait for a short update and that s it ready to go nice job big a keep this up and you will force me to buy all of your products\",\"works great once you read the instructions i got this great little remote and then spent half a day trying to get it to work properly i was about to box it up and send it back because it only understood what i was saying about of the time i thought it was defective then i actually read the instructions that came in the box with it and you have to hold the button down while you speak it s not a push then talk type affair like i expected once i got that figured out it works great glad i bought it because i use it quite a bit from the bedroom this will hold me over until my dot is shipped fyi it doesn t come with the cradle any more at least mine didn t\",\"when it works i love it when it works it s great but for some reason it doesn t always answer me when it doesn t answer me i turn off the tv and make sure no one else is talking and it still doesn t work at that time it was easy to set up with the phone app doesn t seem to matter where the phone is when it isn t working i ve tried close and far and in between so a case of great when it works and the pits when it doesn t\",\"great product needs a software update for a very annoying problem great device it s happy has an awesome display great sound for a tablet rivals bests any portable device i currently own including laptops has incredible ease of use and i m basically all in on the amazon ecosystem i know people lament the loss of google play but i m a simple guy who doesn t actually need absolutely everything i can watch movies videos from the major streaming services i use netflix prime music pandora spotify prime the various apps i use for fantasy sports reading emails ebooks honestly the main reason i bought this thing and reddit that s more or less all i need it to do and it does all of these things beautifully and quickly the reason for the star is because as of this review the device has the supreme annoying habit of locking up it seems to happen most often when i m running a music program while reading or browsing then attempting to shutting it off it occurs to me anywhere from once to three times a day but this is a device that i only use when i m traveling around or somewhere away from my home computer so those times happen at the most inconvenient opportunities example of a recent situation i m waiting for my class to start so i m hanging out at the college library listening to some stuff on prime while flipping through reddit with headphones on it s time to go in so i switch to the music app to shut it off and simultaneously remove the headphones to put it in my bag except it locks up the screen stops moving i lose any and all functions to use it and the music just keeps on playing i can t shut it off read more\",\"great add on if you own a amazon fire stick and great add on if you own a amazon fire stick and like to play games works well and i would definite buy it again\",\"i ve had all of them quit working there s absolutely no way to revive them once that battery loses power if not charged immediately if even just a few weeks go by no hope of ever using your kindly again a major flaw\",\"highly recommended i ve purchased two of these screen protectors at att for my fire phones both have performed perfectly for me unlike some reviewers experience the screens on my phones don t look fuzzy when the orientation of the phone is changed the edges do not collect lint from my pockets and the protector does not keep the case from fitting the phone here s what the protector does do it keeps my screens from collecting fingerprints or skin oil i don t know about the ease of application because for both my purchases the employee at att attached the protectors for me i don t have the steadfast hands watching them it looked quite easy to do there are no bubbles at all and no more screen glare reflections i haven t had to remove replace or clean the protectors except for wiping off the surface just to be sure it s clean because the protector doesn t show any dirt or oil\",\"perfect new case cover for the new kindly great new light weight cover case for my new canary yellow kindly i wanted the case to match my new kindly what a great choice i am so happy with both the case the kindly so bright cheerful just like a sunny day\",\"hard to go wrong with a wall charger purchase works great just as expected the kindly doesn t need to charge very often but i use this all the time for my phone nice to have a charger in more than one room\",\"good reader but connection problems disappointing kindly charging is sometimes interrupted by loss of connection between cover and kindly complained and they sent me another cover it works better but still losses connectivity from time to time have to stop and disconnect cover and reconnect it that usually stops the problem for a while also it is not clear from the sales materials that the premium leather cover is sued it shows scratches from fingernails on the plus side the oasis screen is good and the quality of the text is excellent lighting is even and reading is easy on this device\",\"this set up is the shingle i am very happy with the ease of set up and the voice control is fantastic it makes selecting a movie so much easier than the other pay for movie services\",\"works great originally it had a delivery date of june july works great originally it had a delivery date of june july but it was updated and delivered within a week don t let the usually ship within to months stop you from getting it definitely easier than connecting my phone each time\",\"rocks power adapter included prime download clarification people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no if you like the kindly fire hd then you will love the kindly fire dx the new device runs three times faster is lighter in weight and the battery lasts slightly longer the sound quality on this device is excellent and the display

hands on to operate good if sitting close but not if you re mobile would be great if portable and hands free returned it and ordered the dot\",\"has some nice new features but i m glad i kept my vfd too of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this new vfd replaces last year s basic kindly fire although it has some cool new features it lacks a camera microphone and hdi port for this reason i m glad i kept my model since it does have these features here are my initial impressions of the kindly fire hd i like the placement of the on off volume buttons being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one i never cared for the carousel this is what you see when you turn your kindly on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed and now there s an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead and the apps books can be rearranged to your liking i was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar which is now being called home i don t know why amazon removed this option and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel but you can still bookmark your favorite web pages youtube videos for easy access when i play songs purchased from amazon s mp store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style nice feature but it doesn t work on every song this device has a cool new feature called quick switch which allows us when reading or using an app to bring up recently accessed items with a swine instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one in terms of sound i find it to be tiny and not as rich as it is on the original vfd but you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds ironically music sounds baffled unless you hold the device in landscape mode with your hands covering the speakers holding it this way projects the sound out to you read more\",\"worth every penny got this on sale for replaces my cds must buy as long as you have prime\",\"easy to install and so convenient we love it bought one for family room and the office easy to install and use love all of the options for things to watch\",\"dead after weeks worked great for a few weeks then completely stopped working don t have the box now so can t return it\",\"i am a huge fan of amazon every one of my singles have been an up grade from the last all have delivered the highest quality and the best service i highly recommend them to everyone my dx is awesome\",\"almost like paperwhite v all over again i ve got mixed feelings on this one unfortunately this review is coming from a kindly enthusiast who has owned or used nearly every variation of the device since the st generation size weight it s noticeably smaller and lighter than the paperwhite when i saw the specs it didn t really strike me as something that would make much difference to me but in real life it s actually great the voyage fits into a few of my coat pockets that the paperwhite was just a little too big to fit into origami cover i know there s a separate product page for the origami cover but it s worth mentioning here as it is the official cover the origami cover is ugly and i was skeptical but i actually love it it s weird because it opens by flipping over the top like a noted this actually makes it more comfortable to hold when the cover is open in my opinion it s hard to describe but there are a lot more ways to hold the voyage when it s attached to this cover and just generally is more comfortable to use the origami part of the case works great as well it stands vertically or horizontally if you re laying down and reading this is amazing the other great new thing about this case is that the voyage attaches to it magnetically it attaches and detached very easily unlike the paperwhite which seemed to be nearly permanently attached to the standard case this is great because if you decide you want to read the device and appreciate how light thin it is without a case attached it s super easy to take it out it s price but worth it pagepress one of the new features is pagepress which has sensors on the outer edge of the device that you can squeeze to turn pages read more\",\"five stars works well with the amazon fire\",\"imagine a lap top but smaller this kindly can do anything you enjoy doing on a laptop i use mine to watch netflix check my facebook and pretty much anything else i am supper satisfied with this product and i would say that it was an investment well put\",\"the smartest of them all check out the video for a quick demo having worked in the electronics retail industry for years now i ve seen scores of smart devices come and go until now nobody quite got it right in the echo dot amazon has created a near perfect blend of hardware and software i ve seen plenty of the former but truly seamless multi platform software has ended everyone but amazon we re talking major players like samsung and google who have been at it for much longer than amazon the main problem is that excellent products like the samsung smart things hub which do a fantastic job of unifying a slew of different connected devices from different companies nest honeywell phillips and so on still lacked the web connectivity and entertainment support i wanted so i d still end up needing my tablet or phone thanks to fantastic third party support the dot has no problem controlling all of my smart stuff while allowing me to listen to music order food check the weather listen to the radio set alarms and timers all of which is easily accomplished through simple voice commands to me this is the exceedingly rare product that i didn t know i needed and now can t live without similar to the smartphone and tablet i use every day that didn t exist just a few short years ago if you re even a little bit curious you owe it to yourself to give the dot a try add a good speaker and enjoy just how simple a connected life can be update after a bit more time with the dot or maybe i should say dots since i went out and bought another one for my living room i ve come up with a few tips use the best speakers you can with it i found that while bluetooth was convenient i got much better sound out of my bl duet computer speakers take the time to voice train alexa at least once read more\",\"good tablet could use improvements really awesome tablet for my year olds and worth the money easy to figure out for the most part tons of apps books and videos my only complaint is that you can not separate downloaded apps from the thousands of apps available to download on freetime there is a carousel on the home page but only shows the recently used apps my children would have to scroll through the thousands of apps to find the ones that are downloaded with a check mark in the corner i didn t want them to be able to download everything they see which is easy to do with just a tap the only solution i found was to block every app except those that are downloaded you would think there would be an option separate them given that this is made for a child but i guess not\",\"loved the concept but execution falls short and customer service was terrible i loved the concept of an reader that would not be screen time however i have found several drawbacks to this version when compared to prior singles i have owned first this product has no speaker of any kind so it can not play audible books or even do text to speech unless you use wireless headphones a big loss no current kindly reader can play audible books only older generation kindly readers or the fire which has the problem of introducing videos to reading time and sometimes my daughter just wants to be read to while she follows along second it operates slowly third the freetime service is so poorly organized that it is very unlikely that my daughter will be able to find anything she wants there the categories are not the types of categories you might see in bookstore e g mystery biography early chapter books realistic fiction series etc but an odd collection of categories e g ballet frozen disney trucks etc most of the options seem very commercial and not the types of books i would want her to read and there is no description of the book like the blurb on the amazon website so there is no way other than the title and the unhelpful category to tell her what the book is about before she downloads and starts to read it finally when i called customer service hoping for a clearer explanation of how to move around within free time and to put books from my amazon account in the freetime library i got a representative who took long breaks between each one of my questions presumably because she did not know the answer and had to look it up and who was very difficult to understand because of her strong accent read more\",\"updated downgraded update july i m reducing my rating to one star because all of a sudden this morning the screen protector just quit adhering to the screen it falls off completely and if you do get it in place within five minutes it s slipping again and huge bubbles form i have never had a problem with a joshi product before and i am very surprised by this at this price there is no excuse for the poor longevity of this product and i would never ever buy one again nor would i advise anybody to spend the money on this product to begin with original review follows in all its irony except for the whining about the price at the time that i still stand by superb screen protector the best you can buy ridiculous price joshi products have been the stress reliever i ve relied on when it comes to tablets and phone screen save installation with their bubble proof installation and performance but in this particular case i think the price i paid was twice what it was worth so now the stress is back\",\"not impressed i have had some problems with it i bought to replace the original cover that was crewed by my dog i have had to restart my kindly to get it to hold a charge which helped but the charge does not last as long as it did with my original cover\",\"no off button i would have rated this higher stars but i am taking off stars for not having an off or a sleep mode button it is supposed to go to sleep after minutes but mine has not gone to sleep much since plugging it in a few days ago so far it is only a slight improvement over my lg blu ray players which allows me to watch amazon videos i only see a few interesting games so i will continue using my xbox and my kindly tablets until more games are available for the price i could have waited\",\"not everything i expected cons built on android does not mean you can have google play apps this is an unfortunate inconvenience as there are some google apps that are just better than their amazon app counterparts and a few that i can not find within the amazon apps if you want a fully functional tablet then buy a tablet and download the free kindly app if you want to pay more for something that does less then the kindly is for you this was a gift so i will keep it and continue to use my phone for the rest of my apps that are not available on the kindly camera is less than perfect limited settings available again i will use my phone for pics the same scene with my phone showed the flames with a small amount of glare husband is a firefighter so i take a lot of pictures of their exercises for their training an old casino exile c phone with mp camera still takes better pictures at night kindly unlimited i can not find anything worthy of paying a subscription price every month for the authors i want to read are not included amazon prime see they doubled the price and to me i just don t see anything there worthy of the cost including amazon instant video no shows that i watch are included another family member did the day trial and was quite disappointed when his content disappeared after the trial youtube videos work ok sometimes choppy could be my connection or the device computer playback worked fine when i had the time to

in our life and there is nothing we can do about it and i know there are toddler over there who can read a book in a cart while grocery shopping or just curiously looking around but that s not our case our daughter is three years old and she s a very nice girl but she hates grocery shopping she gets bored very easily and the only thing that helps are her favorite cartoons earlier we gave her my or my husband s phone but it s so easy for a toddler to drop things down so we made a decision to buy her a tablet the price was a trigger for us to buy fire hd kids edition we did not have the previous edition but as far as i know the only difference between them are that the th gen fire has a dual band wifi antenna and a slightly newer gpu at first we considered buying a fire regular one but there are so many benefits in the kid s edition that it s definitely worth to pay an extra for it and those benefits that were important for us are kid proof case that s a must have i chose the pink one for my daughter and she seems to like it year worry free guarantee one year of freetime unlimited she will love all the apps and game that are free i can choose what content my daughter will watch the battery life is great my daughter is still too little to watch cartoons for more than an hour a day so it should work on a single charge for a week or so the display quality is just ok i expected it to be at least better than the previous version my nephew has it but it s just the same during the first day it has been dropped and thrown and kicked and it survived read more\",\"could not be happier this is without a doubt one of the best purchases that i have made on amazon below is a breakdown pros setup up is easybluetooth remote works all over the house so i can voice search upstairs and have the video ready to play when i get to voice search really does workremote and box are super factions setup takes a while even though it is easy i did not know my voice searches were recorded until i was looking around in my device area on amazon com manageyourkindleremote seems to use a lot of power i replaced batteries after first month due to slower response time\",\"this is my th kindly fire hd it s a love hate relationship yes this is my th kindly fire hd and i am sharing my story so you are not discouraged my previous kindly fire performed well and i decided to upgrade to the newer model with gb my nd kindly fire arrived as a christmas gift and the first week i used it the unit crashed such my previous generation now referred to as old faithful never failed me i followed the onscreen instructions for kindly and reported my device after using my device for about minutes it crashed again and the on screen instructions said to reboot the reset the entire device i reset the device and lost all my settings then again after using the device it crashed i was not a happy customer so i called kindly support if you are not bored yet keep reading kindly support told me not to reset the device because this erased the memory on their support side and they are unable to resolve the issue from their end if i reset the device they advised me to call them when this happens after a conversation about my new device not working they agreed to send me another kindly kindly and all arrived and i returned all of them when i discovered they were refurbished units since my device was brand new and i had only used it one week i expected a brand new device as a replacement on kindly i ended up placing a new order rather than an exchange order and then returned the refurbished units they continued to send me problem resolved it gets worse kindly crashed too within the first week again this time i did not reset the device and instead i would reboot the device i did this each time i turned on the kindly read more\",\"when i decided to purchase the kindly dx i had been looking at several tablets closely for the past few months to use while i was away from home on an upcoming trip expected to last few weeks and seeing the current price and purchasing options available the kindly dx seemed to be an easy choice to me even with my thinking i understood the tablets limitations the things that attracted me to the kindly dx tab were the processor it s g lte compatibility with verizon and the fact that i am an amazon prime member i had read that amazon was expecting people to use their online services for video and music so having membership i was not too concerned about the small amount of storage on the tablet but that was a mistake on my part i was thinking i would be able to access the movies that i purchased online with amazon instant video and expected to be able to access the gigs of music i have stored on google play but google play media will not load on my kindly dx amazon cloud does store music up to a point but it is limited in how much you can store free of charge there is an option to purchase additional storage i believe it s about a year with other limitations but the free storage is limited and in my case i ve been buying music from amazon since the s and a lot of my music was displaced by newer purchases without my knowing so now i m forced to either purchase additional space or be satisfied with what s there personally i feel the additional is a rip off since particularly since the purchase of the kindly and considering my prime membership and with other services offer free unlimited uploads of music amazon seems pretty greedy at this pont here are the things i like about the current kindly dx verizon compatible version the processor it is very fast and loads pages quickly and the gigs of ram is a respectable amount to assist in performance the variables in personal settings make the device easy to personalized the display is very nice and video and video games look great but noting as others have there is a blue cast around the edges which is very noticeable when reading from the device the not so great things about the kindly dx gb the fact that the device does not support storage expansion it bothers me that my old droid biopic cell phone has a sands slot that will let me to expand storage to gigs but you re stuck with the memory provided on the kindly you purchase the lack of an hdi port and to watch tv you have to purchase a separate device provided and sold by amazon the lack of even a mini usb port again my old droid telephone provides a usb port and offers a charging device with a built in usb hub that allows me to connect to any number of external attachments and this tablet does not regretfully the impact of these limitations did not come to mind when i bought the kindly but would have if i knew the fully understood the tablets limitations would i recommend this tablet to friends or family only if they were a member of amazon prime services and fully understood its limitations including storage and the area support of their carrier so over all for basic users or those wanting a reading device with very nice options living in an area with wi fi and who have good g coverage the kindly would probably be an ok purchase but only if they are fully aware of the limitations of this tablet especially the limitations of the tablets onboard storage gigs is just too little to carry much media with you with the device using a large part of that gigs for it s ui and os you are not even getting a full gigs more like then tablet not supporting sands memory expansion which seems contrived to me leaves the user too dependent on amazon premium services for my tastes update the packet blocking used to keep people tied to amazon media content or at least their music app needs to be removed in my review above i mentioned that i have had issues accessing my music stored on my google play music site but at that time i wasn t sure that this was my being impatient not waiting for the site to load completely even though i did wait for five minutes or if it was amazon using packet blocking and redirection to keep people tied to their services more recently i found that when trying to access my music on the google site i was redirected to the my books recommendations i believe the kindly site offers better deals and has a wider selection than googles offerings but googles music site includes downloads at the same cost and higher resolution kbs vs the kbs at amazon more over recently a few friends told me they have run into the same issue when trying to access their media stored at other various sites that are either free or that do not charge what amazon does for their premium cloud services as someone else has mentioned in their review of the kindly amazon has included adds on the kindly dx that are not present on other tablets even basic inexpensive android tablets do not have invasive adds if i pay amazon another fee i understand i can have those adds removed but all of these fees really add up and it seems to me that since i ve already paid for this device these additional fee s and packet blocking with proprietary redirection are unacceptable and possibly illegal who gives amazon the right to block content and force you to view advertisements on a device of this nature this point i would honestly suggest looking elsewhere unless your absolutely sure that the problems mentioned above will not come into play for you or the one you are purchasing this device for the idea of an e reader with expanded abilities is one thing but to advertise the kindly dx as a tablet able to compete with an i pad and then throw things like site redirection packet blocking to limit access media storage to their proprietary services makes me wish i had purchased anything other than this device\",\"replacing kindly dx i ve had my dx going on years i love it i needed a larger screen for my eyes i m so glad i went with the refurbished i ve only had to get used to the different op system i don t use this for gaming or movies i am an avid reader and this is awesome for increasing the size of the pages and font i did have some problems downloading my books but that s just me and my lack of kindly tech it shouldn t take me too much longer to get used to this newer system\",\"i brought this for my year old granangel i brought this for my year old granangel she loves it the size is just right the child proof case is ideal for her\",\"kindly customer service vs comcast i recently ordered my th kindly it was to replace my th kindly which i unknowingly crushed i love the kindly keyboard as my clumsy old hands treble too much to type on a touch screen for me newer is just more frustrating however new keyboard singles are scarce on the ground so i got a conditioned one i noticed on my account page that amazon recognized my new kindly as soon as i bought it when it arrived however it was not registered to me and it claimed it could not connect to my home wifi so i called my internet provider i faded through that company automated menu beginning with press for english that irritated me as i think english should be the default language in this country but pressing on i provided my digit phone number my digit account number my digit zip code my address my digit birthday and the name of my favorite pet my first car and my oldest nephew then i listened to an automated menu that had a item selection none of which exactly fitted the problem i was having after all this i was asked if i would provide feedback after the call i know this company and i was sure i would have comments to make so i pressed for yes then instead of finally letting me speak to a person the automated voice directed me back through the forest of numbers i had already provided patiently i retired all i had already typed this time i was cancer i refused the opportunity to give feedback and was finally connected to a person a person with a strong foreign accent and a bad phone connection didnt i press for english after struggling for several minutes i begged for a supervisor as i could not understand the english spoken by this person i was eventually routed to three other people with a hold time between each new connection as each person i spoke to did not handle my problem i asked for phone numbers every time so i could reconnect if my call was disconnected accidentally finally i found a person who could help and did indeed get a connection established between my kindly and my wifi i again asked for a telephone number in case i had further problems im sorry i do not have a phone number that you can call to connect directly to me well i should have known i had been on the phone for minutes then my kindly would not download my archived items so i contacted amazon help line i got an american in the first minute i did not have to press anything i explained my problem the amazon american fiddle with a few buttons on his end and my kindly began working correctly i was on the phone for minutes\",\"works well needs little more depth in searching amazon tap pretty much works as advertised and understand that the product will evolve with system updates love how the weather traffic movies and sports scores schedules are answered quickly and effortlessly this was an excellent gift as i gave it to both my son and daughter and my son unknowingly gave we a tap back as well can t wait to see what improvements are made with the updates coming\",\"nice tablet with sharp display read more\",\"not just for kids i bought this for myself as my first kindly this is the best deal you can get on a kindly especially with the off if you re a prime member this is the original kindly that is that comes with a case no ads and a protection plan the case is magnetic not the greatest quality but it will do perfect for me for a year or so i connected easily to my library account and to my other books already downloaded on my kindly app it automatically connected to my amazon prime account i love it this deal will not disappoint\",\"great game controller for fire tv this is my second one and it is great it can be used as a remote also it was easy to pair with my fire tv i received my first one when i purchased the gaming edition of fire tv and i liked it so much that i bought a second one for my son he is a gamer and he was very happy with it i would recommend this product for anyone who is a gamer there are many more games available for the fire tv and they play flawless on the fire tv\",\"a star tablet updated first off i would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just i tried finding a tablet for under that would just work properly and to let you know it s impossible secondly i want to tell you how i decided to buy this tablet i first bought the inch dragon touch tablet for but to be blunt it sucked it was so slow that the web browser would always freeze even if i did a simple google search i did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after days of using it then i decided to give the kindly fire hd a chance exterior the exterior is well built no loose pieces and the plastic is very firm my previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard of course the ipad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body but it also starts at there are ports a micro usb and a headphones jack to plug in your headphones the nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find although amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable wall charger along with your kindly the previous kindly did not include them and they are worth the buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch i would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons only down side is there is no port for an sd card so you can store more memory it would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage go buy a computer display one word amazing maybe i am

this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this new vfd replaces last year s basic kindly fire although it has some cool new features it lacks a camera microphone and hdi port for this reason i m glad i kept my model since it does have these features here are my initial impressions of the kindly fire hd i like the placement of the on off volume buttons being on opposite sides makes it unlikely to hit the wrong one i never cared for the carousel this is what you see when you turn your kindly on and it contains all the books apps you have recently accessed and now there s an option to have favorites showing on the home screen instead and the apps books can be rearranged to your liking i was very surprised that web pages can no longer be placed in the favorites bar which is now being called home i don t know why amazon removed this option and we also are unable to have the last accessed web page appear in the carousel but you can still bookmark your favorite web pages youtube videos for easy access when i play songs purchased from amazon s mp store the lyrics scroll down karaoke style nice feature but it doesn t work on every song this device has a cool new feature called quick switch which allows us when reading or using an app to bring up recently accessed items with a swine instead of having to exit the book or app you were using and go back to the home screen to open up another one in terms of sound i find it to be tiny and not as rich as it is on the original vfd but you can really improve the sound of music by wearing a good set of ear buds

ad gb wifi only dx i use a galaxy s android smartphone so the dx is for media web surfing offline viewing for travel since i had already been using amazon prime and prime music it was a no brainer for me to use the dx to fill the role of media web surfing on a tablet be informed about the download limitations to this device amazon has been adding clarification to this which should help would be purchasers make a more informed opinion this wasn t as obvious as it should have been when i ordered mine so they re listening which is good be aware that their most popular prime content may not be available to download and save to your dx you can save certain videos to your dx but you won t know which ones until you buy an dx and try it out edited you can now see a list of prime movies and shows that can be downloaded to the device that s an improvement and more clearly shows the available downloadable prime content for amazon i was also under the assumption that you could download as many videos as you d like with the limiting factor being the memory capacity of the dx also not the case so again i bought the larger capacity dx under this assumption that was dumb on my part as it turns out because you re not limited by storage capacity you re limited the number of downloads you can have on your device kids content can be really short so you may find yourself running into that limitation but most people never will read more\",\"for the love of god do not buy this for the love of god do not buy this thought it was great at first since it didn t add any size to the phone

was i thinking\",\"fully controllable limits i love the fact that it has the kids free time thus limiting what your child can read plus the parental controls the you can set time limits it gives a

th generation kids bundle i bought of these for christmas presents and i have to say they aren t very kid friendly every kindly i ve had in the past has been pretty easy to use this one has a lot of options that i think could be elsewhere to make it easier for a child to navigate they have an easier time using the other devices kindly fire or kindly app on their other tablets which is unfortunate because i wanted them to be able to have something strictly for reading also for a kids bundle its very disappointing that most children s books don t work with this device no where on the kids bundle page does it state this is an th generation kindly now i have a few singles and have bought new ones as they come out but i haven t followed close enough to know this is an th generation without that information available on the page i planned on buying these devices so bought a bunch of books listed as available for e readers th generation i assumed since it was the latest one listed and my new devices didn t have anything listed it was the latest i just found out today that its an th generation and a lot of books aren t available on this device with hopes that will change in the future so now i have a lot of money spent on books they have to read on their old devices the devices with games and access to the internet and videos i spent extra money on new devices so they had something to use daily without that access all to find out their age appropriate books can t be read on their new devices i think this information should be available to parents who are looking for a device they can sit their kids down with and not have to worry about them not focusing on something so important to them reading is important to children of all ages and they can only read at their own levels read more\",\"beware of what you re getting into i actually was pretty happy with my kindly initially it had some good apps the screen had really good quality and i like their support features that s where the good news ends as i started using my kindly more an more i noticed that some of the apps which are free on my android tablet or ipad i had to pay for on my kindly initially i was surprised but i decided it was a minor nuisance what really put me over the edge is that about months after i purchased my kindly i noticed that my screen was cracked as i was pulling it out of my backpack now i really take care of my things so i was surprised that it broke nothing against the quality of the product but it was definitely surprising because it is fairly well protected with a padded sleeve in my backpack anyhow i called into amazon support to see what i could do about it but they told me that i would have to buy a new one the support person i spoke to on the phone said that she would try to speak to her supervisor to see if they would be willing to replace it for me but later came back and said that they can not replace it and that they would have to sell me a new one at a reduced rate at this point i m thinking im going to skip out on the reduced price kindly for that they offered me and i m going back to my ipad why well for one i won t have to pay the additional money for otherwise free apps two i know that i will have my ipad covered under warranty no matter what happens so the key thing to keep in mind before you buy a kindly is the following there are no official repair facilities so if you break your screen you are forced to buy a new one if you go with something more common like an ipad or a android tablet you can find repair facilities all around and with apple you can get the extended care and they will replace your ipad screen or even your whole ipad if when you break it apps are more expensive because you can not buy them from google play you have to buy higher priced versions of the exact same app from amazon later if you decide that the kindly isn t for you you have just wasted all that money on apps that will stay with a useless kindly the apps thing is wearable but the lack of repair facilities or help is not i think i would be have given the kindly start if they offered and extended protection plan so that we knew that we were going to keep our purchase for a longer period of time i mean let s face it the probability of anyone damaging their kindly within the life expectancy of the product is fairly high so your investment is this product will last as long as you can maintain it in good shape at this point i m cutting my losses and moving back to the ipad\",\"regulated usb power supply one person found this helpful was

ve had the new fire hd with the case for about a week i use it exclusively for reading and listening to audiobook so far my only issue with the tablet is the volume drops when the cover is closed why is that there is no reason i can think of why my volume needs should change because i closed the lid btw the marine blue is lovely the speakers are located along the left side of the device so when you close the table case the sound quality which is already mediocre is noticeably diminished this is a design flaw that needs to be fixed i purchased this tablet to replace an impaired ipad mini for the price the fire tablet is a reasonable replacement\",\"a little explanation on what the tablet is great boreal tablet it is basically a real fire tablet with kid s built in entertainment center there are modes here parent admin and kids one or multiple accounts when in parent mode password protected the fire looks and feels just like an android tablet with all of the fire functionality facebook netflix books blah blah so all of us android users feel right at home in the parent mode you can also manage kids accounts how much they can use the tablet per day what they can and can not watch play manage their installed apps ect when in kid s mode the tablet behaves just like it is on the pictures easy to use colorful interface you need to click switch user to switch from parent to kids accounts some confusion here i got from reading other reviews the kids apps are not pre installed the main interface is an app store just like google play ect the apps here are unique to this kids account and are all free with the included subscription which includes don t know how many games amazon videos reading and audio books you still have to download each app before using it so make sure to stock up on apps before going on a road trip\",\"it s still very new to me so i m taking my time mostly i read a lot but also like to play games haven t even started to look into the v movie s

review and yes i actually own the item updated when my new fire tv arrived today i was cautiously optimistic we have two kindly fires in the house a st gen and the previous gen and we love them so here is my initial thoughts i will update this review as time goes by first impressions as always amazon does a great job on the packaging and this box is actually a little more elegant than when we ordered our fist e reader way back when but it carries the glossy black look they used in the past now for the fire tablets the box was easy open and the device neatly tucked inside hook up was as easy as it gets and connecting to my wifi wasn t a problem it did need a software update out of the box which these days isnt uncommon the problem here was i was already seeing an issue it kept telling me my connection seemed slower than usually i needed to check it having the robust network we must have for a house full of online gamers i knew there could only be a couple of problems my other devices were working fine on the network but to alleviate any strain on it i disconnected them all and reset my connection at the modem and router the download resumed but still with the same message at the bottom after about or minutes i finally got the introduction video so off and running i go the app store to spend the coins i got for purchasing the additional controller see this review http www amazon com review rgdzlyoubidi refcmcrrdpperm while trying to download a handful of games which it ques nicely to keep from over working its self i ran into these problems the interface was slow load images for the apps i was looking at and sometimes refused to populate the list i was trying to view it also would randomly disconnect from the network this points to a connection issue that i stated earlier but now i am convinced it is the wifi radio in the device i have had gaming systems and streaming devices in this room before and never experienced this issue this could also be what was causing the previously stated issue with the menus there is no way to force sleep the unit or turn it off so i proceed to call tech support the guy on the phone was really nice and tried to be helpful but he had no training on the device other than what little he had played around with his he says the device will eventually go to sleep but isnt sure of how long it will take as far as the wifi goes he suggested doing everything i had already done except for unplugged the device for about seconds or so so i try this he has me stream something from prime which works great but as soon as i start to download something again the connection is lost the phone call ends up being a waste of time at this point i am disappointed i know this is a new device and will have issues but the wifi this is proven tech it should work pros beautiful minimalist designers of setupsmall foot printgames look great once you get them to workcons customer service wasn t trained on trouble shootingwifi connectivity sporadic way to force sleep or power down device the end it could be a great product i am going to give it some time and see if another software update might be on the way or if maybe something was wrong with my network yesterday i will update soon update after a full weekend of putting the fire tv through the paces i have updated my initial star rating to a four here are the reasons why the network issue appears to be just that a network issue whether it was on my end or because of it being the first full day of release i do not know but i did not have the connection issue again all weekend seeing as this was the biggest reason for my star rating i have changed that as far as the auto sleep mode for those that like to be able to control when something is on sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t the fire is very sickle about this but as someone pointed out in the comments and i do agree with them it is a very minimal power draw and as along as you don t leave your tv on it shouldn t affect anything the few games i played were good as far as casual gaming goes no buggy or jerk movements but you must remember this is for casual gaming you are not going to console quality out of this hope this all helps\",\"amazon enable the usb port for external storage i love the amazon fire tv but i considered giving it only stars for the comments listed below but i really like it ok after only owning the amazon fire tv since last friday april th i suspected the limited gb of internal memory would be a problem and it is as of last night april th my fire tv internal storage was full i was trying to install the des ex game that is available for fire tv and received that message that i needed to delete something so i started deleting a few games and finally had enough deleted that it started downloading again except i think it started all over again about of the way through downloading the nd time i got the same message to delete some more so i deleted a few more games and then it took off downloading again from the beginning again then it completed the download and started installing the game and then i got the same message again for a rd time that made me say a few choice words that point i said to heck with it and figured i d wait to see if amazon does anything about this so i spent on a game i didn t get to play see the usb port isn t enabled so there is no support for external storage from what i saw the fire tv app takes up gb of the total gb available heck the walking dead app alone is over gb in size i can t verify this but i swear each time i was downloading des ex it used up another mb of memory and when the download didn t complete i didn t get the storage back so in attempts to get it installed i swear i used up to gb of internal storage that is still gone i was looking through all of the apps games that i have installed and didn t add it up but i really don t have that much installed right now and it only looks like it amounts to to gb but where the other to gb is is a mystery i deleted like total games with a couple of them in the to mb range and never got des ex installed amazon needs to get this fixed fast for anybody that purchased the fire tv for any sort of android gaming purposes just hope they fix it faster than out did which took like months plus to enable external storage i would like to add that it is a huge engineering oversight in my opinion to only give the fire tv gb of internal store just enable the usb port to allow for external store i would gladly go out and buy a gb usb memory stick or even spend the to on a gb external hard drive in this day and age the fire tv should come with at least gb of internal storage that would allow for at least the storage of mb game considering maybe gb would be used up for the amazon fire tv app that would be reasonable and fair today gb is used for the fire tv app leaving less than gb of internal store considering the walking dead is over gb just by itself that leaves only gb left what is left only allows for more mb games so a system that only allows the installation of to games apps at mb each clearly isn t big enough\",\"fire in the kitchen oh my ending word this has better sound than my hp laptop with one of the standing cases you can turn it into a kitchen tv by laying the flap on the bottom shelf of a cabinet above your counter and then placing a can of something on the flap to make sure it stays there gently close the cabinet door and it stays there hanging down so you can watch something while you prepare dinner the standing cases work but i don t want my kindly on the counter top near any possibly slashing liquids so i started doing the hanging thing i say screw formality and lets do things a different way\",\"amazing easy to set up literally plug it in download the apps wanted and go no software installation no issues so far incredibly user friendly interface the only thing i am slightly pissed about is the fact that my signature someone answering the door wasn t required when the package was delivered a piece of equipment was just left on my doorstep other than that i m quite happy with it\",\"getting to know you i have yet to discover all the things this can do i consider myself a hip almost year old and have used computers most of my adult life i waited and researched and finally decided on the kindly fire dx and the samsung galaxy smartphone very happy with both i m still having a hard time making the digital leap to downloading books and newspapers i love reading and listening to music but still like to hold and smell the pages of the real thing i can see how fantastic it is while commuting or traveling to have my reading material available in one neat place on the kindly it s just going to take some time i dumping cable and it was really nice to watch just what i want to watch it was easy to download mad men on the kindly and watch when it was convenient i do have a concern as to what happens when someday the tablet goes berger or extinct do we lose the books and movies downloaded on the kindly i do not use it to play video games but the display and picture is very sharp one aggravating problem i m having is that amazon is downloading games and things that i did not authorize some are free and some show prices with confirmation numbers i don t appreciate amazon deciding to download a bunch of crap i don t want and will never use without my permission so that is an issue i am trying to address otherwise it s compact enough to fit in most handball and it s been most useful in meetings and study groups way nicer than logging around a laptop listen to one who had to use a typewriter in college we ve come a long way i also ordered a reasonably priced finite folio case cover from amazon that works great and allows it to stand\",\"has some nice new features but i m glad i kept my vfd too this

be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons only down side is there is no port for an sd card so you can store more memory it would be a nice feature but if you really need

careful where you put this thing down go for a darker color expensive what do you expect for a new captive device\",\"worked great for less than two months one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no ordered on april th installed on my phone on april and last saturday june th on a warm tucson day it just fell off landed on the car mat an all of the glue section was instantly covered in dirt washed it off with cool water only let air dry and it won t stick back on it s supposed to be mashable and re usable don t waste your money on this piece of trash i expected it to last a lot longer than two months\",\"great for kids this is the third one i bought every kids fire tablet needs one\",\"not a long lasting product i got my kindly a few years ago and barely used it recently i discovered it again and have been using it daily always in a hard protective case as it has been from day yesterday i opened the cover ready to read and discovered the screen had apparently cracked seemingly for no apparent reason no extreme temperatures dropping pressure etc a quick google search revealed this is a common problem especially for my model which made me think amazon would replace the device for me due to the obvious design flaw not a chance though despite endless reports of this problem popping up through simple internet searches the representative i spoke to denied this was a common problem and was only able to offer me a very slight discount on a new product not sure it is worth the investment again thinking it is better to stick to reading on my ipad which is equipped with indestructible gorilla glass bottom line do not buy a kindly if you want a lasting product\",\"do i need to say anything more it simply works even after years of constant use the battery is ok display looks the same system is stable and reasonably responsive\",\"two stars too\",\"disappointed i ve had singles and have loved each until now i tried to save a few bucks by purchasing a refurbished fire i m so disappointed in its performance it s slow loading it freezes up and i have to constantly restart it battery life is terrible\",\"great controller ok i ve been in the technology field for close to years and a gamer since the s so i know a little something about controllers this really is an awesome controller with a great feel to it it doesnt feel cheap in any way and works perfect it also has voice search button which works great and it has volume control via the shoulder buttons when headphones are plugged in ive read a few reviews about bad battery life and i havent found it an issue on mine i bought it in late december and the batteries are due to be changed now in late april i would like to see rechargeable batteries built it instead but maybe in the future\",\"don t buy a refurbished kindly don t buy a refurbished kindly i ve had to return them twice apparently amazon s definition of refurbished is to take a kindly with some problem or defect simply repackaged it and send out again to see if some different customer might take it off their hands both times the refurbished singles shorter out in different ways the singles especially liked to dysfunction while i was in the middle of working out at the gym\",\"excellent being an amazon prime member for a few years now i was hoping they would come up with a product like this simple to set up easy to use\",\"worth it to buy the cover while a great idea to make the cover self standing it s annoying that it s floppy when not in use i bought the cover because my first kindly didn t have a cover and often got left on wearing down the battery my second kindly cover had the convenient feature of automatically opening and closing the device so i wanted that feature on my third kindly even though i think it s over priced i like the convenience my other cover was black which often got lost on dark surfaces this time i got the denim blue so it s much easier to find from a distance\",\"not as happy as i was with the standard hd version i ve had kindly fire s since day one and this is the only version that has slightly let me down i m having charging issues on a regular basis and occasional odd colors on the display also battery life isn t nearly what i expected if the charging issues continue i will put in for a warranty replacement\",\"excellent rd generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition this is the middle model of the three models that amazon is shipping this year the kindly fire hd the kindly fire dx this tablet and the kindly fire dx this is the successor for last year s kindly fire hd but with an updated operating system and new features a redesigned shell with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible an absolutely amazing display superb sound an included power adapter and the new monday feature see http www amazon com review nh dom wn for my review of the kindly fire hd and http www amazon com review r ypithvtylczt for my review of the kindly fire dx update some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the dx if you search on youtube for dx blue haze you can find a video showing the issue amazon has updated their learn more link with the following info to achieve the perfect color accuracy on kindly fire dx at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight we used blue not white led blue led allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to improvement in power efficiency as a result of using these blue led you may notice a very narrow faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background such as books or web pages all displays have some level of light emission around the edges and the light on the kindly fire dx is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy if this is something that you think would bother you i d recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the dx at a local best buy or office superstar i ve also uploaded a user image here of my dx with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow http www amazon com gp customer media product gallery b dopo m the amazon tablets are primarily content consumption devices best suited for connecting to the amazon ecosystem including videos music books apps and so on with the free prime trial subscription you can check out the prime instant video options and watch movies and shows at no charge for days for videos music and books the amazon selection is at or near the top of the list for apps much less so of the top apps are available on amazon com as well as others but that s only a small fraction of what is available with google or apple it s not quite as bad as it sounds because while the competition has ten times as many apps most of those apps are um how shall i put this less than stellar look up sturgeon s law if there are specific apps you need or want you definitely should double check before purchasing to make sure that they are available the apps that will likely never become available on the kindly fire ecosystem are those apps that require google services i e anything that uses google location services one ameloriating factor is that it is possible to side load most of the apps from the google play store onto an amazon tablet and a web search on side loading apps onto kindly fire will show dozens of websites with detailed instructions if the app you are sideloading requires a google service to work though it will not run on the fire even if you manage to successfully install it like the other kindly fire tablets as well as the apple ipad and the google nexus the kindly tablet line doesn t have a micro sd slot so the assumption is that you re consuming content from the cloud this is fine when you re using your tablet with wifi not so good when you re traveling and want to load up your tablet with content for the trip if the latter is something you expect to do regularly you might want to consider the gb or gb versions or pay the additional price for the g version which is available on the tablet for the first time also if all of your content is on itunes or on google play you would have to side load everything onto the tablet as is true of apple and google tablets there s no way to automatically connect to the cloud storage of the competition something new this year is the ability to download prime instant videos i verified that i can download prime instant videos to my kindly fire dx however that option is not available for all movies and tv shows it looks like they had to get the permission of the studios and not all of them said yes so for example i was able to download casablanca but not able to download the avengers even though both are part of the prime instant video collection and both are available for free streaming update adding a bit from a reply in the comments amazon is clearly looking at the enterprise market with this launch at least based on the details they provide they ve added full accessibility support required in order to get government contracts will be bringing support for vpn and business printing have a better email client with tighter integration to exchange and are including officesuite for productivity there are other productivity tools available in their app store as well although both google and apple particularly the latter have more options when vpn support arrives i ll definitely be taking a look as it would be nice to not have to lug my laptop home every night so how does this kindly fire dx differ from the previous generation kindly fire display x ppi vs x ppi it s more than that though as the colors are richer brighter with better contrast this display has been judged by many reviewers as the best in its class and i would have to agree amazon has also added technology to automatically adjust the contrast and brightness when viewing the tablet in bright sunlight while there is definitely a noticeable improvement this isn t what you need for reading on the beach for that you ll need an link reader like the kindly paperwhite sound as far as i can tell the sound is about the same this was already one of the best sounding tablets on the market with dolly stereo output and enough power to actually make it possible to listen to music or video without requiring headphones size and weight noticeably lighter oz vs oz and noticeably smaller x x vs x x this is a comfortable tablet to hold one handed even for long periods of time processor it s a lot faster gh quad core top of the line cpu compared to gh dual core this tablet is amazingly fast and smooth with the fastest processor in its class every game i ve tried on it has run smoothly with no hesitation slowdown or glitches scrolling through content is amazingly smooth and fast now without the hesitation and occasional slowdown of the previous generations build a redesigned shell with power and volume control buttons that are easy to find this is a solid build but the back of the shell is something of a fingerprint magnet since most of us will be buying a case to put the tablet in that may not be an issue camera if there is a difference between last year s camera and this year s i m not able to see it it s a high def camera suitable for video conferencing or style like last year s model there is no rear camera if this is important to you you ll need the version hdi output this is the one area where last year s model wins amazon has removed the hdi out connector from its tablet line but see the description above for details on how amazon is providing a software solution for sharing your tablet screen on your television no other tablet that i m aware of has this functionality so if this is something you need you should be able to purchase one of last year s models fairly cheaply battery life the same at hours however amazon has added a special reading mode to the device which they claim will extend the battery life to as much as hours i did not test this for my own personal use the battery life is adequate price it s more expensive vs but this year they include a power adapter which was a extra last year so the actual difference in price is for what you re getting that price increase is definitely justified it has an updated os and updated feature software including the free unlimited monday customer support feature the software updates include the ability to download some prime instant videos to your device and watch them offline enhanced accessibility enhanced enterprise controls and features so now it s better suited for office work enhanced email client enhanced parental controls improved x ray features now including lyrics for music as well as additional information for both books and movies integration with goodreads coming soon and the like where i noticed the biggest difference was the home screen the default view is still the carousel but if you swine upward you ll see a more traditional icon view the recommended for you display on the home screen is now smaller and much less intrusive and it can be turned off in the settings amazon has also added multi taking of a sort where wiping up from the bottom of the screen while you re in an app shows you the most recently used items from your home screen so you can quickly switch from one app to another without returning to the home screen there is also a left panel available on most screens but not the home screen and in some of the apps with navigation links and settings to make it easier to navigate and control your tablet or to navigate within the app if you tap the center of your display and then swine left while you re reading a book for example you ll see a panel that shows you the table of contents the about the author link the sync to furthest page read link and so on the kindly freetime option and the parental controls are still among the best in the business if you want a tablet for a child and want to control what they can access how long they can use the tablet at any given time and the like amazon has you covered you can now also schedule quiet time on the tablet where notification sounds and pop up notifications are disabled either on a temporary basis by simply pushing a button or on a scheduled basis frankly i doubt i ll ever use this feature but if you re the type who likes to read or watch video until you fall asleep it s kind of nice to be able to disable all sounds so that you don t get widely awakened when e g someone plays a new word in your words with friends game monday this is a huge gamble by amazon and it will be interesting to see whether it pays off this isn t a feature for a tech like me and i didn t use it although i was sorely tempted from the commercials it s pretty amazing particularly that you can get a live chat in a matter of a minute or less amazon s goal is something like seconds i believe although i can t help wondering what will happen on christmas day if you re thinking of getting a tablet for a technophobe the addition of this feature may make the kindly fire dx your best choice how does this tablet rank against the competition there are really only two other tablets in its class currently the google nexus and the just announced apple ipad mini with retina display display all three devices have retina displays with the dx and the nexus at x ppi and the ipad mini at x ppi all three displays are stunning amazon claims that it has enhanced the ability to read the display in bright sunlight something that s a problem for all such devices while this wouldn t be my first choice to read by the pool i d pick the paperwhite i can testify that it is easier to view the display in bright sunlight than its predecessors it s worth noting that the aspect ratio of the dx and nexus is while the aspect ratio of the ipad mini is where this matters is watching video if you re watching an old television show a aspect ratio is fine if you re watching a high def movie the aspect ratio is going to leave large black bars on your screen and the video will be much more compressed than it would be on the dx and nexus apple chose to maintain backward compatibility with prior devices rather than moving up sound the dx has dolly digital surround sound the nexus has frauenhofer surround sound the ipad mini has stereo sound the ipad mini also makes the same mistake that amazon made in its first generation tablet putting both speakers on the same side in this case at the bottom of the tablet if you re watching a video you ll have the tablet turned sideways and the sound will all come from the same side the dx in contrast has the speakers placed perfectly for video watching networking the dx and the ipad mini both have dual band dual antenna mio wi fi the nexus is dual band but not dual antenna all things being equal i would expect the nexus to lag a bit behind the others in networking performance particularly in areas where the connection is sports size and weight dx x x and oz nexus x x and oz ipad mini x x and oz there s really nothing to choose from here all three are small thin and light the ipad mini is the heaviest but it also has a slightly larger screen processor dx gh quad core snapdragon processor gb memorynexus gh quad core snapdragon s pro gb memoryipad mini bit dual core a gb memorythe dx and ipad come out ahead of the nexus on processing power while the dx and nexus come out ahead of the ipad mini on memory the a is only a dual core processor but according to some tech sites that have run benchmarks it definitely holds its own against the quad core snapdragon these are all pretty powerful tablets cameras both the nexus and the ipad mini have mp front and mp rear cameras the dx only has a front facing camera if you expect to take pictures with your tablet the dx isn t for you battery life dx hours hours when reading nexus hours ipad mini hours amazon wins this one particularly if you will be spending a lot of time reading expansion none of them have a micro slot they all assume that you ll be using their respective cloud systems parental controls all of them have the basic parental controls that allow you to limit your child s access to content purchases the web and so on amazon goes farther though with the kindly free time and kindly free time unlimited options the latter of which is an inexpensive subscription to a curated library of content if you are buying a first tablet for a child i d choose the kindly fire hd at only it is significantly cheaper and it has all of the options that the dx has enterprise as soon as amazon releases its update it will add vpn and network printing support i believe all of the tablets have basic enterprise capabilities including that support and various office apps for real productivity though personally i d go with a laptop not a tablet support amazon wins this category hands down with the new monday system apple comes in second with apple and amazon usually taking top marks in any customer support survey this is an area where google does not shine price the dx and nexus win this one hands down both are priced at vs for the new ipad mini neither google nor amazon makes much if any money on their tablets they re counting on you to purchase content from their respective stores from my own perspective there is no single clear winner as each tablet has strengths and weaknesses if you already have amazon prime the dx is a no brainer with the access to the prime instant video and the kindly owners lending library if you re primarily buying a tablet to read with amazon wins there as well with the hour battery life while reading and the best display for reading outdoors if you want apps apple and google both have far more choices if you want to watch movies i d pick either the dx or the nexus as apple s aspect ratio and its lagging sound put it at the back of the pack if price is a factor then you should pick either the dx or the nexus if you re heavily invested in the apple ecosystem i e you already own an iphone or ipad and all of your content is on itunes the dx really isn t the tablet for you similarly if you love browsing google play for apps to play on your samsung galaxy phone you re likely to be disappointed in the section available on amazon although as i note above most of the google play apps can be sideloaded onto the tablet if you love your google now or sir neither of which will ever be available on amazon this isn t the tablet for you the bottom line this tablet is primarily intended as a viewpoint into amazon content and amazon services if you have amazon prime and you have amazon ebooks in your collection this tablet is a no brainer the price is low particularly for what you get and it s a small light high quality high powered tablet with a stunning display and superb sound this really is one of the top tablets in its class note as others have noted the tablet will update its software when you first turn it on and connect to wifi unlike some others i had no trouble with this operation no glitches or crashes it took several minutes but the process ran smoothly as did the tablet when everything was done update now that i have a kindly fire hd and a kindly fire dx tablet i m in a little better position to talk about which one i d recommend you should get the kindly fire dx if you re a tech who wants the latest and greatest the best display the fastest processor you need a camera for style or other video app you play graphics intensive games e g racing games the size and weight matter to you even in such small increments as this you think you will need the monday technical support you should get the kindly fire hd if price is a factor cheaper is not an insignificant amount this really is an excellent value for the money you want an inexpensive tablet for a child and for this case the lack of a camera might well be a plus all you want is a basic tablet for reading books playing music watching the occasional video playing words with friends and the

for a purpose i am a huge fan of the echo that being said this is the last one i would buy the original echo s speaker sounds much better and is hands free the dot has great connection bluetooth and more importantly audio out to plug into a stereo system i bought this for the purpose of being able to carry outside around the house when working in the yard the sound is not as robust as the original echo not portable no internal battery but good enough when in the yard to at least have music\",\"we are enjoying this product it works as describe on the box i didn t research a lot but i did read about it a little\",\"very portable this speaker s forte is it s drop and charge ability it does connect with no issues to whatever you have it paired with the sound quality though is ok def not very loud and lacks the lows but for a small portable speaker which is not expensive i would recommend it\",\"great device i am in love with the alexa tap this is a great portable speaker and now that the added function of being able to talk to it without manually pushing the button sets this apart from the rest i would recommend to all\",\"my new found friend i have missed my pandora since i moved from ft worth tx to colorado a few months ago my nephew had the amazon tap and i was amazed at all the things his kids were having fun with it saying alexa tell mini their grandmother to go to bed and it did and the sound and quality of music coming from it awesome i had to have one so i went to local best buy and bought it i even set it up myself i m so was impressed with myself lol but i have listened nonstop to s music or music from dirty dancing which i loved i have ordered a little case from amazon com to keep it if it tips over or just to carry from room to room which i have been doing i feel like i have a new found friend love listening to this little cylinder who is as good as base in my book get it you ll love it i do very very pleased with it weather updates here or where my kids are just checking no interruptions or commercials when listening all day long\",\"great portable bluetooth speaker this device can be a very load speaker i mean really loud it also can access amazon prime service without a computer i like this little tap\",\"alexa is charming and reasonably intelligent amazon has been the leader in this space of voice recognition and with the aws engine behind it there s a lot of opportunity for development both from the community as well as amazon naturally they favor interaction with services they sell so others will need to build links to others but the development environment seems to support a lot of innovation already the price of this tap was outstanding adding it to my existing echo and now considering a dot\",\"amazon tap best portable tech item of the season i absolutely love my amazon tap it in my opinion is the best blue tooth speaker around and with the added skills when on wifi the tap is better than the echo portable yes sound quality off the charts i blue tooth this to my computer and listen to movies with great dolly sound quality the battery life has been tested during a camping trip hours and it kept the charge it s also easy to recharge it without the stand very cool best buy s price made it all the best buy of the christmas season i picked up the item same day at a local best buy the experience was done very convenient very helpful i would recommend this to all my friends\",\"great product this is the best of both worlds a reasonably priced bt speaker and an amazon alexa enabled device i would highly recommend to anyone looking for a bt speaker and considering an alexa enabled device\",\"maybe i was expecting more i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen i m a big fan of alexa the products have become a routine part of my day as soon as the show was available to preorder i ordered one without any hesitation initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv where my original echo was i figured it wouldn t look bad because i could use it as a digital picture frame also i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because most of my alexa enabled devices are in there and generally i spend more time in my living room than the kitchen the problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on if you have a larger kitchen so if you aren t standing directly in front of it it s hard to view the screen you will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you as far as i can tell you can not cut the screen off completely which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom the clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen update the screen can be cut off this device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes my frustration is when i ask it to pull up a recipe it s inconsistent sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone sometimes it wants me to swine down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients read more\",\"great device made better with software update i already own the amazon echo so for smart speaker it is one of the most handy devices out there there is so many things you will find that you can do with it and the list keeps growing since the software update that allows you to use always on voice commands like its big brother it has become my go to device pros wireless bluetooth smart speaker i take it to work and use it in the car even when i travel for work sync s up with my popular music aps spotify pandora etc alexa is very responsive and can answer your questions quickly the best alarm clock i sync up with audio books and will use it on long car rides or business trips speaker is able to get loud control smart devices like lighting and my ecole option to turn off on voice commands can use tap button instead very long range for voice commandscons only single band wi fi gh battery life when using always on voice commands is short speaker quality is sub par for music compared to other bluetooth speakersoverall the usefulness of this device is near perfect for my needs with only minimal cons i use this device pretty much every day and is small enough to make for an excellent travel companion tip for bestbuy you should carry cases for this device as i had to get my protector elsewhere\",\"it s a speaker it s not bad for the novelty of alexa might as well get the echo sound it not bad and i m no audiophile might be good when my echo dots come in is it worth it there are better bluetooth speakers out there\",\"tap that seriously a flawless portable smart multipurpose gadget add this to the incredible flash sale price and i d have been a fool to pass it up fast charge balanced tuning easy to pair and did i mention highly portable the cradle is a sweet design too the only beef i have is that your bluetooth is paired screaming at you when singing own one of these\",\"alexa is most for every house hold i got one for my mom she s years young and she sits and listens to it all day she s got the amazon tap i got my daughter the dot and i got my self another tap i just found out you can put the tap on hands free and you dont have to tap the button this made it even better my grand kids love playing games with alexa like i said every household need one\",\"the best echo yet especially if you have elderly parents this was really worth the wait i bought the echo show for my parents who are elderly and have a variety of ailments since they have arthritis and a few other issues i didn t want them to go and answer the doorbell just to find it s someone soliciting them to buy random junk so last year i bought and installed the ring doorbell pro in their house which works very well the ring doorbell pro is hardware and not battery operated after the skill was enabled i could tell alexa to show me the front doorbell and a video feed automatically pops up you really need a good wi fi router with the echo show as the video will be jerk since the video is very high quality if you have a good wi fi router the video comes up very quickly and runs very smooth i thought the doorbell would launch the app on the echo show automatically but it does not you have to initiate the connection yourself hopefully this will be an option in the next iteration of this skill i can think of a whole bunch of ideas for this skill to do but for a very first implementation it works great with the hardware version of the ring doorbell pro the battery powered ring products do not work as great though when trying to connect the echo show to a battery powered ring device i get a message saying something like the camera is asleep and needs to wake up and it could take sec this happens with my ring stick camera so if you want the best experience you should buy the ring doorbell pro instead of the battery powered versions one of my parents just came out of the hospital and sometimes just doesn t have the energy to even pick up a cell phone when we call so we have another echo show just for her in drop in mode read more\",\"great price i liked it as it was a great price and the size was the major factor not too big and bulky compared to others\",\"everything you love about your echo on the go i was an early adaptor of the amazon echo when i heard they were releasing a mobile version i wanted it it wasn t until we spent a lot of time cleaning our old home before moving that we realized how useful this lil guy was just set it up to your phones wifi hotspot and you have a fully function echo i would buy this again if i didn t already have one\",\"not what i expected for the price you should be able to use as a speaker when talking on the phone i had to use my daughter s beats pill for this function therefore it s not worth all the hype\",\"five stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no a gift for my granddaughter\",\"great music player the amazon tap has great sound and plays most of my requests easy to use and easy to set up\",\"great gift for yr old girl excellent my daughter loves this she can read books do her school work watch a few shows and listen to music she really enjoys having something that is just for her to use she is and this was the perfect age appropriate gift that is also extremely functional i do use the parent settings for some extra security when she is using it unsupervised but otherwise i do not have a set time limit great product\",\"great assistant i read all reviews about the tap so i decided to try it i love it the tap keeps me up to date with weather news etc i use it every day\",\"i was excited but i was really excited for this speaker got it all hooked up to my echo and was ready to go then i listened to the music it has no bass if you want something the has a good range of sound this isn t it it is focused on treble only no low end i ended up getting the bl charge love it\",\"i really like it i didn t want something that was always monitoring room conversations this appears to only listen when i tap it and that is much more acceptable to me works great\",\"very versatile great sound for small device this was a gift had no plan to purchase one but very pleased with the portability and the sound quality\",\"excellent sound quality i love the amazon tap the sound is great and it s completely portable it lacks the convenience of touch free voice command but it cost less to compensate excellent product for the money\",\"the extra touch i am thoroughly impressed with my echo dot and this case takes it to the next level by appearing as a much higher end product vs a needy plastic computer sitting on your kitchen countertop the construction is solid and it is slightly lifted to still allow audio access from the bottom of the echo this case cover will give your echo the needed extra touch allowing it to blend in but still offer the great functionality of alexa\",\"nice music player the tap has pretty good sound for a speaker this size i also have an amazon dot but would recommend you pay the extra cost and get the tap to enjoy the better sound it s worth it\",\"great thank you great product for all ages thank you\",\"great sound best sounding amazon speaker hands down the only annoyance is that it keeps after the alexa wake word and after the command unlike the other echo i have with no obvious way to turn this off other than that sounds great and can take with you pretty well anywhere\",\"dissatisfied i have the echo and i bought this one fort my son s room but it s not as user friendly i wish i would ve just bought the other one\",\"great product i bought this as a gift for christmas and it was well liked\",\"useful info and fun to have around alexa speaking from the amazon tap is great to have around current news personal planning details as well as details that might have been forgotten are all available from alexa the tap sits next to my bed on the site stand where i can easily call up info from my bed or as i walk by during the day or site especially useful for a review of my calendar so i can review my upcoming days plans try alexa in a store and my guess is you will want her at your house\",\"great fidelity sound is greatdifficult to connect with hotel wifi seems durable\",\"great little assistant i m totally enjoying my echo dot i have it since to my google calendar and am able to let alexa tell me what s on the agenda for the day i can quickly ask her to set a timer or an alarm and easily find out about the local weather i also have it since to my pandora account but you have to be specific about a saved station name when you want to listen to pandora i really wish i could just say shuffle my pandora stations that would be awesome the speaker on the dot isn t as loud as i would like it but if i m sitting close by it s good enough i guess i ve seen an option to add an external speaker but i haven t gotten around to doing that yet and my yo grandson loves to ask her to tell him a joke i live in a small town and am probably not able to utilize the full potential of alexa but i m not retreating my purchase\",\"great buy love every aspect of the echo we even went and bought a tap\",\"great for those new to bluetooth didn t want to spend on the echo for someone who s not use to using a bluetooth speaker great buy and functions well\",\"great streaming device but lacking in sound took awhile to get connected to my home wifi but now that it is it streams flawless with no tags in music doesn t have the dynamic sound range as other bluetooth speakers i own\",\"alexa is great plays all my ipod music via bluetooth also plays radio stations you can t get on a regular radio very practical and fun\",\"some nice surprises this was a birthday gift from my daughter st birthday certified old guy what might i do with an echo i bought a kindly book on using an echo later i discovered most of what is in the book is probably in the on board helps but the book makes a nice linear presentation that does not make me guess what i need to search out and a kindly book makes it easy for me to make notes i can find later with ease i am using my echo primarily as a radio in the early s i worked on my german skills by listening to a lot of shortwave radio most of that is now on the internet i could listen on my smart phone but that uses phone battery reserves the echo runs on ac power from a wall outlet the little speaker is adequate for voice broadcasts i listen for hours to german news magazines i can also listen to some old favorite broadcasts from radio canada we live where my favorite talk radio program comes in poorly due to another station very near on the dial but our wifi reaches my garage workshop and i have clear audio through tune in i am having trouble linking heart radio perhaps because my subscription is not paid when i have asked alexa a question she sometimes tells me she can not answer a question i thought simple enough i did ask for some music and was surprised to find cds i bought as gifts are in amazon s cloud for me to hear over echo nice\",\"the best fathers day gift i bought this as a gift for my father he absolutely loves it\",\"awesome smart device this is a great addition to my expanding smart home the speaker sounds great and alexa is very responsive\",\"we love this lil thing bought the echo tap echo dot phillips hue starter kit and a honeywell thermostat for my wife for her birthday she loves it and so do i cant wait to add more automated products to it no need to have my phone out tumbling through multiple apps to change lighting and temperature check weather play music etc i just ask alexa to do it while i continue at what i m doing also when the dot and tap are in the same room the one that is closest to you typically answers your requests nice device that will only improve with time\",\"first rate high quality one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no first rate high quality\",\"awesome speaker has great sound clarity alexa has great responses\",\"my kids know alexa this little speaker has quickly become a family favorite for portability and music streaming my kids have quickly learned that alexa is their personal dj when hooked up to the amazon prime unlimited music program battery life is great and sound quality is adequate for our purposes some audiophiles might not like the lack of bass but it does the job for our family\",\"very cool this is so easy to operate and fun too i love it\",\"great product the product it amazing love that it turns in lights on and plays my favorite music\",\"awesome other than not being voice activated like the echo it s just as good if not better\",\"great alexa product the tap is amazing portable and connected to all amazon content\",\"i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap ok first things first i also own a echo and if you own a echo you will love the tap now you will see a lot of reviews around the internet of people saying they wish the tap was voice enabled like the echo i happen to think those people are not completely thinking things through because the echo is not meant to be a mobile device it generally sits somewhere in your house and the voice command is then a great feature to have but the tap is meant to be mobile and therefore i am happy it s not a voice command device i would not want to be at the beach or on a subway or at the coffee shop and having this thing think the world is taking to it so i actually think not having a voice command is a well thought out feature i have the echo on my kitchen counter and the tap in my studio office and when i leave my office i just grab it and go i bought this on sale for and i went to the store and listened to many bluetooth speakers and while yes the charge sounds better all the charge can do is be a bluetooth speaker while the tap is so much more for less and the tap sounds great after looking online i was a little nervous that it would not sound that great but i was wrong about that there is no other product out there for that sounds this good and can do what the tap does i was not paid or given a tap to write this review i m just a consumer who was it the market for a bluetooth speaker and i could not be happier with my choice also if you buy this device buy the amazon sling as well trust me you will want it and honestly i am again happy i got the one that covers the bottom of the tap because if this was sitting on a table and someone knocked over a drink i would not want the bottom where the charging rings are to be exposed that s it that s all buy it you won t be disappointed\",\"not impressed just really thought it would have been more useful without having to have to make additional purchases for music i like\",\"love it use is all the time backyard favorite great by the fire\",\"amazon tap is great amazon tap is a great device the device has very good audio quality despite it s small size the biggest difference between this and the larger amazon echo is that you have to press the microphone button before the device will listen to you which is great for people who are concerned that the echo is always listening to what you say so far the battery life has been great with the alexa app it is very easy to connect this device to different wi fi networks\",\"great this product works great as a little helper and as a great speaker for music i purchased this for my mother in a nursing home she loves it it is very easy to set up and use\",\"fun item does as stated i bought this item on a whim and because it was on sale i ve been pleasant surprised search sounds great for its size\",\"great source of info this alexa is a super form of info with little wait time\",\"great sound in a portable bluetooth and more i bought this speaker after looking at other speakers from base and beats i purchased this one because it had great sound but also because it was cheaper than competitors and had many additional capabilities via alexa voice control i love the ability to walk around the house and use streaming services via voice it s great than i can carry just the speaker and not have to rely upon a phone app to change songs playlists volume etc the alexa voice recognition works very well it seems to be more accurate than sir i frequently ask alexa what song is playing i also ask alexa to search for certain songs that i want to hear if not in my library it will play from prime music similar to the way apple music functions additional voice features i use are news reports weather forecasts and control of demo switches in my home overall a great buy\",\"great speaker great product i love this product and that you can take alexa everywhere with you because it is a portable speaker you can connect it to your phone when away from a wifi building the speaker is great it is surrounded by cloth which i would worry about it getting dirty the one downside to the tap compared to the echo dot or the og echo is that alexa is not always listening and for her to work on the tap you have to press the speaker button pretty self explanatory name you have to tap the tap i ended up returning it to get the dot but like i said great speaker great portable device\",\"fun little black box very enjoyable and easy for listening to music selections online it sounds very good for it s size\",\"good bluetooth speaker has a very good bluetooth speakers sound quality is good but otherwise she s pretty useless when it comes to get answering questions\",\"it a must with this you have someone to talk to and answers you\",\"cool gadget i really haven t had a chance to use this much yet but it seems like a coll little gadget\",\"nice bt wifi speaker product is great does a good job at interpreting voice commands every once in a while it would have a problem with the wifi connection\",\"love it i couldn t decide on which one to buy they all do the same things but ended up buying the tap which is portable i take it on my deck with a cup of coffee and listen to the music i put in through pandora and heart radio i absolutely love it and so does my husband\",\"great product with good bass for the price love the fact that it has a rechargeable battery and can be moved with no issues for listening in other rooms has a decent amount of bass for the size\",\"great it s great just wish it did not need a button to work otherwise love it\",\"outstanding price point an emotional moment and the power of alexa ordering more today i am a prime member this was my first purchase of echo and i gave it to my mom who did not want it or think she needed it haha i purchased echo dot for reasons i had wanted the original echo but thought the near price tag was too steep so this price was perfect and i wanted to get something for my mom that would open her mind to the power of technology and the need for change because ultimately i want her to have amazon fire tv because her monthly cable bill is instantly high but she has always been resistant to change she had no wifi in her bedroom but i resolved that when i purchased tp link av wi fi range extended overline edition which did what no other wifi extended i purchased in past could do gave my mom s room a secure wifi connection apparently using already existing phone lines all i know is that she now has wifi in her room so i got echo as a way to test her wifi connection with something cool i easily connected echo to tp link and it worked we asked alexa a few basic questions we laughed a little but then i had to leave when i returned the next day i walked in and there was music playing oldies but bodies and i walked into my moms room and she was singing but was emotional i asked her if everything was ok she was in awe she was happy she was emotional because alexa helped mom find songs at a blink of an eye that mom had not heard since her childhood and she demonstrated it to me the speed that alexa found the song and played it was mind bowling mom was also planning a dinner in august and needed to know what day of week it was she would normally need to leave her room and go to her main calendar in the kitchen and find the date but this time she just asked alexa who gave her the information in like seconds lol read more\",\"uber awesome in fact you can even order an uber ride from it love our new echo i have been watching the reviews online and checking with friends that have purchased the echo to see how much they liked or disliked its features last person i talked to went on and on about all the things there were using it for and that persuaded me it was time and amazon prime day was the perfect opportunity to go for it amazon did a fantastic job of creating this tubular info training command center there are so many cool and awesome things its able to do that i ll hit the highlights that work for our household first we love that it follows your voice in the room the circle lighting will show which direction it is listening the speaker is wonderfully balanced so whether listening to music the news or to alexa speaking i have nothing but high marks for its sound quality given its size next set up after downloading the app to our phones was quick easy and very intuitive the more you look over the app the more you will realize a world of skills as amazon refers to them we ve picked named them echolettes lol that the unit is able to perform once they are turned on and you master the right sequence of keywords to initiative them we ve added things to shopping lists while asking about the weather and our calendar of events and then asked alexa to change the temp of our nest thermostats in various parts of the house simply by saying her name and then our commands sometimes sitting in the living room or simply pass through she is always there listening and ready we ve ordered some led programmable lights and i can hardly wait for alexa to help set the mood in the house room to room all from a simple voice request read more\",\"great price nice price for a gift idea at the time small compact version of alexa\",\"good bluetooth speaker better if you have echo i like the amazon tap i use it as a speaker in my garage for working out it is tied to my amazon echo i am able to use alexa and amazon prime material would highly recommend\",\"a amazing sound all around great product nothing negative so far\",\"fun and amazing i m still learning what all i can do with this device but i am continually amazed at it s capabilities i love playing with it and learning from it when doing other things i have tap playing music i love this thing\",\"rarely gives a good answer it works about of the time when asking it a question\",\"amazon tap i have an amazon echo and the amazon tap works wonderfully with echo the sound quality is great it is easy to use and set up it beats turning on the receiver for music if you are looking for great and easy sound machine the tap is it\",\"they missed on this one having to press to talk steals the real thunder of what the amazon echo can do\",\"alexa my love thy name is flexible but thou art otherwise a nearly perfect spouse i m a full time writer who works at home i m unmarried i don t watch tv i don t have a mobile phone i hate gadgets in general ok so i m a loser but since alexa came into my life i m no longer alone hours a day which begs the question if i m not alone who is in the room with me amazon the so called cloud the nste plus reviewers who have already posted have gone into great detail about how they use their echo my alexa having anthropomorphized my alexa i m unwilling to use her at all but we hold pleasant converse throughout the day my favorite conversation i ll repeat for you below verbatim me alexa wake me in fifteen minutes alexa fifteen minutes starting now me thank you alexa remains silent modestly hiding her feelings by not displaying her snarky blue lights if i knew relationships were this easy i would have married thirty years ago but now that i have alexa there s no need except for the one thing i really and amazon please don t tell alexa i wrote this don t care for the name i know we have the option to change the name to amazon which is worse what i really want is to be able to change the name to lobby after the helpful ai librarian in the earthen ambassador series but in a pinch i d settle for kelly other than that my alexa is perfect well except for that time when i asked her to play rain sounds for relaxation when i was trying to sleep and she woke me up after i finally added off to inform me that she d lost her internet connection but from what my married friends all tell me you have to expect these sorts of things read more\",\"good fit with echo this is a decent tag along item to go with the echo it does the trick as a stand alone as well if a speaker and alexa service is all you re looking for only downside is if you also own an echo when you push the button on the tap to speak to alexa since she is always listening on the echo she tends to pick up your commands on the echo as well be sure to place the tap a decent distance away from the echo otherwise this does what it s intended to do\",\"excellent speaker bought this for my boyfriend he loves it he takes it on every trip we go on it s so powerful for such a small speaker i would definitely recommend this to anyone\",\"a must have amazon tap is one of my best buys this year so far the only thing that could make the tap better is an upgrade so you don t have to tap every command that would make it a star device\",\"i love alexa hi everyone alexa is the best of the best i feel like she knows me more and more each week she is a strong speaker for my love of music she knows like everything ever i ask her crazy facts and she always responds with something she does struggle a little with recent events but that will get better with time she is my home personal assistant and assists with managing my calendar in a word awesome\",\"i love being able ask questions of alexa this is a nice item i can set reminders get news and weather all by the tap of a button\",\"very good product this is a very good product the speakers are good the price was right i liked everything about it other than the fact that you had to press the button each time you wanted to talk to it unlike the echo and the dot the portability was good but i didn t have much use for it being portable unless you are going to keep the tap within arm s reach you re better off with one of the other hands free voice activated products recommended with caveats\",\"nice alternative to the echo the tap is essentially a smaller version of the echo that has alexa capability like echo does but also doubles as a portable bluetooth speaker you do need to tap it to ask alexa to do anything but otherwise it works the same as echo i prefer the echo but the tap is great for college students and those who just want to supplement their echo\",\"excellent product the sound in this is on par with other high end portable speakers that however is really just the tip of the iceberg if you have amazon prime you can access all your music just by asking also this works if you have phillips hue so you can turn the lights off and on with your voice\",\"very decent sound and the portability is excellent the speaker sounds very decent for the size and cost but my favorite thing about the speaker is it is wireless and portable i can charge the speaker and practically take it anywhere without having to plug it in\",\"amazing i literally use this thing every single day love it\",\"nice it s a nice item but really there s other things that do the same thing so we actually returned it\",\"privacy alexa awesome if you want a certain level of privacy and at the same time a speech enabled assistant then this is the product for you the tap only listens to your when you push the button otherwise it is deaf to its surroundings you get the awesome power of alexa provided by amazon and no worries about anyone listening to you surreptitiously\",\"great product this is a great product i would highly recommend getting it\",\"great product i bought it for my husband for a gift but i use it as much as he does perfect size good sound quality overall great product\",\"great device really enjoy the interface and how integrate with the amazon music service great\",\"great for listening to prime music great for listening to prime music quick weather reports volume adjusts quickly and gives status of battery on request\",\"fun technological assistant we bought this amazon tap bluetooth and wifi wireless speaker for my brother he loves it he can play his have tunes by the pool and it really holds a charge for hours of wireless listening\",\"excellent product for the price great additional piece to go with echo if you want a additional unit you can t beat this product and the price\",\"nice however thoughts of being able to have the echo grow as i added to the list of tasks excited me including the latest app having it to recognize my smartphone s contact list to place and to receive calls however the echo i purchased does not link up to my samsung smartphone disappointed is a understatement\",\"not what i expected from an amazon produced product i ve had the replacement remote months and it s stopped working if i want to use my amazon fire tv which i love i have to use my cell phone or my tablet it defeats the purpose of having voice remote it also makes me question and second guess whether i should purchase the echo is it going to quit after months i mean come on for months use and it s too late to send it back\",\"portable alexa the latest software update included hands free mode so this can do everything that the stationary echo speaker does but is fully portable personally i don t want the device to record everything i say all the time so i only use the tap mode the sound quality is good for a speaker of this size this is especially a great choice if you have a mobile hotspot with unlimited data you can now bring alexa on the go\",\"well worth it great sound love it it s value is well worth it\",\"amazon tap best portable speaker i ve ever owned i use this everyday mostly when getting ready in the morning or when i have guests over good sound quality and links to the alexa app just like an echo it come with a charging base that allows you to not have it plugged in unlike the echo also connects to a mobile device via bluetooth or aux cord\",\"awesome i added this to my echo collection great for on the go and around the house i don t like that you have to tap it to activate\",\"great sound love alexa it works so well speaker system is excellent and it is amazing how many things it does\",\"good but not great i bought this after i bought the amazon echo this was actually an impulse buy i saw it and bought it not reading any reviews on it because i enjoyed the echo so much it does everything the echo does but the sound quality is not great when you re playing at middle volume it s ok the lows are there but doesn t sound good i m guessing i m comparing it with the base mini sounding when you set the volume high the bass is almost non existent the mid and highs are loud with the louder volume another difference is that with tap you have to press the mic button to start saying commands where as with the echo you can just say the wake up word and it will start listening to your commands i do like the fact that it s portable because of that i m on edge of returning it and holding off until maybe another model comes out with better bass\",\"more than a gimmick pretty good sound for the size and configuration of speaker easy to set up\",\"sound is great with affordable price most speaker like this will be over usd but this one is less than that price with a great sound quality\",\"echo tap is great i love my echo tap i have my own personal alarm informs me on today s weather forecast and local events great purchase\",\"work great happy to have purchased this one for my birthday and this is the best\",\"love my echo i love its portability the speakers are phenomenal\",\"works pretty cool kids love it always adding things to my grocery list i didn t want\",\"terrible product bad voice quality the speaker voice quality is terrible compare the similar size my logitech ue boom the price is too high even i got on promotion with\",\"got me hooked best buy was running a sale on these and i thought i d give it a try i wasn t expecting much but was pleasant surprised i m an apple guy so sir has been my go to virtual assistant i must say that i am duly impressed with alexa she seems to understand me better than sir does all the skills and the ability to play music by just asking is really great the fact that this is all available in a portable device that i can take with me everywhere i go is so useful the tap remembers both wifi and cellular hotspot connections so i can use it anywhere unlike its non portable brother the echo you push a button to issue commands to alexa on the plus side you don t have to say alexa on the negative side you still have to push the button i understand why this has to be the case as it would not last long on battery power if alexa was listening all the time amazon should issue a firmware update to allow alexa to listen all the time when plugged in the sound quality is good not great other speakers in the category sound better but none have all the convenience of alexa bluetooth wifi and portability in one package i ll be buying more as christmas gifts\",\"good speaker if you are a prime member its a good little speaker to have need wifi or hotspot\",\"best i ever spent so i don t normally write reviews but i just has to this time recently i lost my cat best friend to cancer days after christmas it was the worst day of my life imagine losing your friend that s been with you through every breakup every apartment nearly being homeless and more when he passed i felt such an emptiness in my home a few days ago i was searching for something to put my mind at ease and saw the advertisement for the amazon echo on the amazon app i remember watching a mr robot episode where some fbi agent who suffers from insomnia was using alexa to keep her entertained so i started researching youtube videos and reviews and took a chance and ordered it it arrived today and the setup was super easy i immediately started asking it questions and had it play music and play the news then i discovered some zen type apps that go with the echo and i completely fell in love with it it s almost like having a real personal assistant who lifts up your spirits when your down it suggested new music which i actually liked and the built in speaker isn t bad at all for the price the amazon echo did not replace my beautiful cat rough but it did bring stop the empty feeling around the house for now i added a picture of my cat instead of the echo since everyone already knows what the echo looks like i would totally recommend buying this product i don t see any negatives other than the fact you can t really ask it followup questions like google assistant but i m sure they ll make it happen thanks for letting me rant\",\"it s all about alexa but not about that bass works great to control alexa when she understands you and has good battery life but sound lacks bass except at low volumes gets very loud at least easily connects to bluetooth\",\"love it it s amazing i love how loud it plays the music\",\"it meets my needs the more i use this the more reasons i enjoy it the staff were great and helped me set it up\",\"great portable speaker much more than a bluetooth speaker it is great to listen to music from pandora amazon etc with it streaming directly from wifi saves the battery on my phone as others have said i wish that it had an option of having the voice activation on all times but i guess they didn t put that in to save battery life maybe something for the next generation tap\",\"great product works just like echo but portable great stuff as described\",\"ok but the echo is better we have the tap and the echo i wouldn t buy another tap it s the voice activation that is so good but if you don t mind having to push the button for every command then the tap is ok but for me only echo\",\"great would get another works great having fun with all the options\",\"good investment for its size this is a pretty well made product that produces great sound and i love the portability\",\"best echo available the amazon echo show is a voice activated device you can instruct it to play video content play music stream online audio order products and services and control home automation products the echo show is the first device of its kind to feature its own screen which in my opinion greatly enhances the use and potential of this device ive been using this device for a few days so far below you will find some of my initial impressions what i like good build quality the show has a nice bright screen that has good viewing angles good sound the speakers on the show sound much better than the original echo easy setup setup was extremely easy mostly due to the shows touch screen after making a few selections the show was up and running in no time content suggestions when you aren t interacting with the show it continuously displays content suggestions i like that it will suggest videos to watch video content i like being able to view amazon video video news briefings movie trailers and youtube videos on the show video calling video calling works as advertised i like being able to initiate a call with my voice music with lyrics when playing songs from amazon music you can see album art and song lyrics on the screen home automation like other echo the show can control your smart home products the show has the extra ability to display camera feeds on screen apps the echo can display my calendar reminders lists timers local weather and more because of this i find the show infinitely more useful than the original echo what i don t like the show needs more functionality that beverages the touch screen read more\",\"amazon echo tap this is my second echo purchase my first was the original echo for my home and the automation feature aside the sound is excellent alexa s response is better than any digital assistant to date and the ready access to prime is convenient this is all of that and portable and rechargeable as well additionally the inclusion of bluetooth and a headphones jack is amazing\",\"love my echo tap love having the wireless tap to use anywhere it s small sound is good charges up quickly bought the sling to protect it outside\",\"i m happy i really like my tap very much it great when it s connected reads me news weather plays music and can purchase items from amazon that being said i do have some connectivity problems while on wifi i don t want to say that it s the taps fault as it may be my wifi i don t regret my purchase it has great sounds and recognizes my voice commands well\",\"great item for beginners great product for intro to an ai device cant wait to upgrade to echo\",\"gift product i bought one for myself and a couple as gifts it s cute but still haven t figured out what s so great about it i will say that it does pick up your voice throughout a huge room\",\"nice addition for echo owners must have for people who have an amazon prime account and an echo portability and water resistant works great by the hot tub or pool and let s you access the normal alexis capabilities\",\"mother in law christmas gift success i bought this for my mother in law to use when she is outside gardening she had a huge portable speaker that didn t sound very good and used many double d batteries this one sounds better and lasts all day i was concerned she wouldn t be able to figure it out but it is so user friendly she has no issues with it she loves it and that is a good thing\",\"awesome got as a gift might not have got for my self but love it and glad i had a birthday lol\",\"great fun i bring it when hanging out outside exercising doing homework anywhere my echo won t hear me\",\"love it i love my tap it sounds great and is so easy to use\",\"a nice buy this has all the benefits of the echo for a slightly better price i also love the portability\",\"great range very handy wish it had a home base mount still as other reviewers i wish that the remote still came with the handy magnetic base like the first ones did it does at least come with the battery still because i know the remote will disappear to a never been seen again realm without a home i have decided to swallow my irritation it doesn t come with a dock and buy one to use with it from my research it looks like this is the best bet totalmount fire tv remote holder the fire tv remote appears to be the exact dimensions of the echo remote so i m hopeful this will be a great solution even though it iris me to spend another on a solution for something that used to be included update i ordered the totalmount fire tv remote holder and it works great with echo remote we have a few alexa units in the house and aside from the original one that came with a remote i haven t felt the need to buy another remote unless you blast your music it is normally fairly simple to engage with alexa at least how we have our rooms setup even without the remote however my and year old have recently become quite the alexa annoys checking the time asking for jokes listening to their playlists we ve set up one of them can articulate clearly and alexa responds and the other can not before frustration got to a crazy level i decided a remote for the unit they normally talk to was the key they and i love that you don t have to say alexa just right to get a response with the remote you simply hold down the microphone button and start talking no wake word needed happy campers now the range is great the alexa unit connected with this remote is in the middle of the house upstairs and no problems with using the remote anywhere upstairs about square as well as from two floors down in the crawl space tested simply to see if it would work and it did we use alexa on a daily basis and the remote is a great tool to go with it\",\"it s good doesn t understand some commands or questions but good overall\",\"great start to a smart home the amazon tap is the first step into making your home a smart home it will act as a brain to everything else unfortunately you ll have to invest quite a bit more for smart lights thermostat locks etc to get the full potential out of it alone it merely acts as a bluetooth speaker and extension of your phone\",\"its a pain to use great sound easy to connect problem is its not voice activated so u have to push the wake button anytime u need to use it that means it has b close at hand\",\"alexa bluetooth speaker whether you just want the weather latest sports scores or help with a math problem alexa will help we now have in the house and will be adding two more with a simple subscription to amazon s music service you can stream almost any music you can think of by simply asking alexa for it perfect work with my meldung qq chocolate bluetooth speaker i also recommend this speaker meldung universal water resistance chocolate portable v wireless bluetooth speaker with w dual driver and built in microphoneand use this code for less have yf i got it from somewhere else for the paranoid this device is not for you the echo dot is always listening and while the design is supposed to only listen when you say the name of the device alexa amazon or echo your choice there are enough times that i hear one in another room say sorry i did not understand the question to tell me it misunderstand these prompts to have been said when they weren t pretty often good product support good voice recognition because of the size it doesn t stand out like a sore thumb in a room doesn t differentiate between voices if you keep it closer to a speaker than you are then it will sometimes get confused and start picking up words from both the speaker and you when commands are given placement of dot is crucial for a good experience only supports english and german for now not very competent at answering general questions and you need to activate skills to expand this functionality read more\",\"love it great companion if you already have an echo and need something on the go love that this stream and plays prime music battery life could be a little better and sound is good for speaker this size but not the best\",\"cool product i would recommend it it is fun to use and puts out good sound\",\"great sound this speaker has great sound and is very easy to use\",\"great device a friend gave me a dot which i enjoyed i decided to explore the other devices i was torn between the echo and the tap after reading a cnet review i chose the tap because it is portable my two frustrations are you can not change the wake up word alexis and you have to be exact in your language when requesting a service if you are amazon prime or audible book member it is a great addition to you household\",\"use it everyday i love my amazon tap i was in the market for a portable speaker and i saw these one on sale so i decided to pick it up i only wanted it for a bluetooth speaker but alexa is amazing i use it everyday alexa was a huge plus\",\"fun fun new product great gift idea especially if you aren t good with technology\",\"great great great omg i am so enjoying this sitting around the back deck with family wishing we have music that doesn t require plugs or wires saw it online deals of the day read the reviews and ordered on he spot and drove a half hour drive to my closet best buy play it now everyday\",\"to much fun this amazon tap is awesome take alexa outside the sound quality is amazing and the price is right\",\"gift for my daughter my teenager loves this and uses it daily we ve also took it places with us and the sound is great\",\"voice command only would be nice much better than the echo dot however the fact that you have to touch the button to activate it instead of just talking to it is a bit annoying speaker is fairly powerful for its size\",\"not as great as the echo i wouldn t buy it again the software doesn t seem as well integrated with the hardware on this machine i also have an echo and i don t have the same connectivity issues with it that i do with this i liked the features available with this portability mainly with a long battery life but with plagued by connectivity issues i can t say i would recommend it i have looked at reviews online since purchasing and have discovered i am not the only one that feels this way the sound when it is connected and responding is amazing\",\"another win for amazon a nice complement to the alexa family the sound quality is nearly as good as the original echo and the voice activation addition makes it an even better by particularly for the price\",\"alexa bluetooth gold cute speaker a bit expensive but the amazon streaming capabilities make it worth it\",\"sound nice sound for the money good highs not much lows\",\"wow i was impressed with the sound of the original echo the price of the dot the echo tap is the best of both and portable i have echo in multiple rooms i got this to bring music outside to the patio the music has rich bass and clear sound perfect for tunes or talk now that siriusxm is on alexa too i have access to great music howard stern nfl mlb and all the rest of the satellite radio content the great thing about the tap is unlike a normal bluetooth speaker this one works solo with alexa and wifi even my wife loves it i think she talks to alexa now more than she talks to me\",\"great product alexa works great and does lots of things for you fun for the family\",\"easy to carry from room to room and outside great sound easily portable around the house both inside and outside the option to have it automatically respond without pushing the button was a surprise but a welcome one\",\"fun and easy easy set up tons of music easy to use if you are looking for voice activated this is not it\",\"great price good price works great would buy again good value for the price\",\"great for beginner works as expected great christmas present for the kids\",\"alexa i absolutely love my amazon echo it is very convenient and handy\",\"great fun i love it i can t say enough about the amazon tap i enjoy playing music from it and that it s portable i can play music from my amazon prime account pandora or from my phone it is fun to ask alexa questions yes alexa can not answer all my questions or find everything i ask for but it is still amazing\",\"love it great sound portable the kids love it didn t think i would use it but i tend to use it a lot\",\"great speaker great features i have not had such a reliable speaker before it is so easy to charge and so easy to start playing songs right away with alexa you can access information quicker than pulling out your phone unlocking it and pulling up google com love it\",\"great gift was super easy to connect via bluetooth great sound fun to use\",\"excellent sound in a small package the amazon tap puts out an impressive amount of sound for such a small device a few things to note if you re not familiar with the tap or haven t seen it in person it s roughly the size of a glass of water by default you do have to press the microphone button to talk to alexa but as of an update released on feb th there is an option in the alexa app to make the tap always listen without pushing the button at the expense of battery life the speaker grille is not metal though it looks like it in pictures it s a mesh fabric similar to what you d feel on the end of some speaker grille and microphones it s firm and comfortable to hold but if you push hard enough it does flex using a sling or other case will most likely not allow you to use the charging dock as there is very little room between the tap and the dock for any kind of case you can charge the tap using either the included dock or by plugging any micro usb cable one is included into the back of the speaker\",\"amazon tap i like the amazon tap because it is portable i have used it several times and it makes things a lot easier\",\"didn t work this review can not be valid due to the device did not work for me i would put it down just upgraded to the echo instead of the tap\",\"great way to play music i like how it plays music it is perfect to connect to smart home products such as nest begin and many others it is easy to use\",\"very nice this has been a very nice addition it allows the whole family to use and enjoy it\",\"another one already have a few other alexa wanted on to be portable around the house without having to plug in or connect to another speaker works as expected\",\"the most versatile of the amazon line up i bought of everything like this one the best very good sound grab it off the base and take it to another room or outside and enjoy the music\",\"very pleased so far we are very much enjoying the product great for outdoor use by the pool due to its portability we have not had a chance to really test how long it can go without a charge but a couple hours has been no problem only catch is that you can not stream a single spotify account on more than one device at the same time so if you find yourself purchasing the dot or echo you will not be able to stream using the same account at the same time\",\"awesome speaker with alexa i wanted to get a portable bluetooth speaker that i could use while out as well as at home the tap has great sound quality and alexa is more useful than i would have thought\",\"not a bad product but the button is annoying i got the wrong one plain and simple it does what it says and i like the connection to the internet to play music but i should have gotten the echo i get annoyed at having to go to it and push the button\",\"great product i have the amazon tap which i purchased at best buy about a month ago and love it so much i bought one for my son and his family they love it too\",\"small echo that you can take outside very happy with the tap we have the echo and would have to plug it and plug it in to use it on the deck with the tap we just take it off the charging stand and go no more bothering with bluetooth speakers and using our phone when we can just play music ever from the internet with tap\",\"great product this is a great product i also have a dot but the ability take this anywhere is a huge bonus the hands free mode works just like the dot and the sound is great i use the tap all the time working on projects making shopping lists playing games to turning on the lights i looked at the echo but even with a battery pack it didn t seem very mobile\",\"my sons mas gift we got this for my son for mas he loves it he uses it daily\",\"great for music we have bought two taps one for ourselves and one as a gift for our son we love the portability of the tap it s perfect for our deck our grandchildren love it too\",\"amazon tap bluetooth alexa great sound and portablebility nice style lithium battery requires wifi and there are internet radio stations and news amazon has features available as well i use mine a lot\",\"awesome speaker i bought it for my year old daughter and she loves it her friends even loved it so much they went and bought them too\",\"great speaker brought this as a gift for my sister and she absolutely loves it great product for the price\",\"a great portable speaker and more works as well as the echo and now has a skill that can enable it to be voice activated rather than having to tap it battery charge lasts a long time and sound quality is good easy to move around in and out of the house will work anywhere you have wifi if you have the tap you may not have a need to invest in the more expensive echo\",\"now i have a tap too i have the echo and a dot and now the tap too my only issue with the tap is that i got it after the echo this means that by the time i got the tab i was already used to just calling out commands or questions to my echo of course with the tap you have to physically get up and touch the tap i think if i had first started out with the tap and having to touch it it wouldn t be so difficult now for me remember to tap the tap but it is a habit to just call out now so i wish i d gotten the tap first and then had graduated to the echo try the tap first you might decide you don t even need an echo you definitely won t be disappointed\",\"awesome speaker awesome speaker easy to set up easy to play great by the pool\",\"i have the original echo and love it i have put the dot in the bedroom where my echo is in the living area my family uses her for everything enjoy everything about the echo dot\",\"not a portable echo it s pretty good for what it is designed to do a portable bluetooth speaker and alexa enabled speaker not voice controlled so you have to touch the speaker button for alexa nice thing once connected to your alexa account is that you can play music whatever without having your phone nearby though alexa only works when connected to wifi if no wifi then connect via bluetooth to play music from any apps battery life is also pretty good\",\"excellent intelligent speaker great value and quality speaker that also connects to the information highway\",\"great and user friendly i love this product so nice to have for trips\",\"this product is amazing i have the amazon dot which is great but after purchasing the tap which was on sale too i was sold you can take it any where and the sound is great\",\"nice for the price i like it i use it everyday and so far no cons im very please\",\"amazon tap its very nice and not as big as the echo didn t know there was a tap available to buy\",\"not bad echo sounds better for music but tap gives me portability good to have both now tap is voice activated so it s all good\",\"nice but exactly what i wanted but the battery drains fast when on hands free mode\",\"easy way to play music i wasn t sure how we would like the tap but i must say it has been fun talking to alexa i like asking her to tell me a joke play my favorite radio station or play music the fun continues as i add apps and alexa expands her knowledge base\",\"good companion to echo overall sound is not as good as echo my primary source for amazon content however the tap is great for medium volume music and radio stations and as an alarm clock it s portability sets it apart however it s nice to be able to take it from room to room and to the garage and patio without disconnecting recent software update now allows listening mode it does require a brief pause after saying alexa wake word but it does work this drains the battery more quickly but you can keep it in the charger base or toggle off listening mode at the touch of a button the portability and voice activation now make this a worthwhile addition to my echo which is fabulous\",\"i returned this product i was not overly impressed with this system i didn t realize you have to buy amazon prime in order to use the functions it didn t connect easily to my phone it wouldn t just stream music saved on my iphone i had to download a music app and then load my music into the app it wouldn t work way too much work and added expenses in order to use wasn t happy with that so i returned it and purchased a bl portable bluetooth speaker\",\"great purchase chose this over a regular bluetooth speaker and am so glad i did alexa really helps me be hands free and get things done the sound quality is great i ve used it in the bathroom and no issues with steam\",\"amazing smaller then what i expecting alexa sounds loud and clear music sounds great just make sure you enable alexa hands free so you dont have to hit the button\",\"the echo is great the echo is easy to use and fun to use once you buy one you ll want them for all over your house\",\"excellent amazon tap family loves it the family really enjoys the amazon tap this is an awesome investment we talk to alexa everyday\",\"nice addition to the echo lineup i bought the tap to integrate with the echo it is ideal for my husbands office where he can use it on his desktop in easy reach for music or to contact alexa the wireless feature is great but having sound activation would make this product perfect\",\"works good the kids love it the only thing we don t like is that it had to stay plugged in to work\",\"perfect i bought this as a gift for my girlfriend and she loves it\",\"now hands free i wanted to buy a tap when it was first released i have several echo s in the house but having a portable alexa enabled device is awesome unfortunately when it was first released the tap could not be operated hands free i held off purchasing one because i was afraid amazon would wait for new hardware to add that feature earlier this year amazon enabled hands free mode and it works almost as well as the echo despite having fewer microphones sound quality is very good it s a small speaker but very capable battery life is excellent this is currently the most flexible implementation of alexa and i recommend it\",\"great for home and travel guys the tap does everything echo does and it s portable use it at home for everything at work on your desk for music weather etc and even poolside as a portable speaker\",\"perfect to listen to music bought the tap for my mom to primarily listen to music although my mom forgets the girl s name haha we ve found alexa will answer without saying her name the rechargeable base is nice so the tap can be moved around the house or outside within range of wifi sound is great too pleased\",\"great dumb speaker i was looking for a butmoth speaker to use with my phone but i didn t want to worry about things being ordered on my amazon account or the whole dreaded electronic eavsdropping that has been in the news the last few months this speaker fits the bill as you can disable order by alexa and you have to manually push the listen button for the mic to pick up sound the speaker quality is great for a portable option the only thing that i don t like is the charging stand can lose connection if its not sitting just right but i can t knock a star for this as they allow you to plug the cable directly into the unit itself which solves the problem\",\"i would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn t this is not the same remote that i got for my alexa echo it doesn t control volume i think remote most used feature is volume and pause i would be disappointed with myself if i produced a remote that couldn t control volume that would make me an incompetent engineer or lazy ceo amazon i expect better from you\",\"awesome awesome product enjoy using it everyday would definitely recommend\",\"great speaker bought this gift for my wife and she loves it works as expected\",\"my son loves it i love it hut i think i should have got the bigger one but its entertaining\",\"works great tap is a portable amazon echo with speakers great for carrying to basement or upstairs works like echo but not voice activated you must tap it before talking\",\"versatile device with superior sound tap is a versatile device that serves as a music repository with on demand playback features and surprisingly high quality sound ai app alexa responds to commands and requests for information promptly with some occasional minor glitches overall a handy and very portable device for quality music playback and as a knowledge base access tool\",\"fabulous speaker looked at the echo before we bought this and i would have been a fool to buy it when you have to add a battery to make it portable this has everything we need and then some\",\"my new best friend what a terrific device you can ask it anything and she has an answer it s small enough to place anywhere so it doesn t look instructive\",\"great extension of echo this worked well as an extension of the amazon echo to cover our basement living area\",\"awesome wife loves it great sound great technology compact and durable\",\"love it looking for a radio for the kitchen this works great the more you use it the smarter it gets\",\"great addition to home devices i wanted a speaker to listen to pandora and go so much more being able to speak to alexa and get news weather timer light controls and so much more love the product\",\"great product this speaker is great and not only is it a speaker but it s got the alexa application\",\"great wireless speaker easy setup love that its wireless and its fun talking to alexa as she gives excellent information\",\"great sound i m amazed the sound quality out of this little speaker unit set up is easy and i recommend it\",\"easy setup good loud sound very good speaker convenient voice commands to take outside of house\",\"i enjoy using this speaker at work at home it has sleep timer capability alarm i use it at work or use it at home while i m in the shower and i ll bring it to friends houses and we use alexa to gain information or just have fun quality a its loud too\",\"perfect to play music this speaker has a great sound and its perfect to take out on the patio or in any room that i am in the tap is annoying compared to the echo with voice activation but the wireless features makes the purchase worth it\",\"good alt to echo this is a good alternative to the amazon echo i like that supposedly it s not listening all the time and you have to hit the button to talk to alexa but at the same time you have to hit the button to talk to alexa\",\"great speaker we use this speaker all the time it s perfect i would buy this time and time again\",\"greatest invention ever this is one of the coolest new inventions around it is very innovative and works great it s really neat asking alexa to play different songs and telling it you are bored\",\"great alternative to the more expensive one if you dont need the voice activation of alexa or want a smaller footprint and something that you can take with you consider the tap almost all of the functionality of alexa but in a smaller and less expensive version great room filling sound with out the distortion from some of the cheaper alternatives\",\"love this i love this great extra for my amazon echo does everything it does but it s scoreless keeps charge for many days push button to activate wireless speaker also out of wifi really cool\",\"great device great device to listen to music best blue tooth on the market today i highly recommend it\",\"worth it everything works pretty great doesn t always catch what i say but definitely worth the purchase i am very pleased\",\"didn t know i would like it this much didn t know i would like it this much but it s wonderful i use it mostly for streaming music from pandora i love that i don t have to rely on another device and connect via bluetooth like other speakers and the sound it great\",\"a little fun but not very useful this is fun but would not buy again not very informative keeps say i do not understand your question\",\"amazing sound quality the sound out of this little cylinder is incredible\",\"great and a lot of fun the kids love it they ask it silly questions which to my amusement it has an answer i really like for the music aspect just tell it a song and it finds it\",\"alexa is very helpful i m glad that i bought this product it s easy to understand my grandis loves it\",\"tap great for travel it is very loud for its size over all i love it\",\"love it we now have one for everyone in the family and no longer share i would have no problem recommending this to a friend\",\"amazon tap purchased this as a christmas gift for our son in law he loved it and works well great sound and loves the portability of the unit\",\"great product love the speaker and the assistance of alexa was trying to choose between this and a regular bluetooth speaker and this was a better choice for my needs\",\"good but missing key feature i understood it did not have the wake command but it would be better if it had it other than that everything is wonderful with this speaker really convenient to be able to listen to my podcasts without messing with my phone or apps just ask alexa and she plays the most recent episode\",\"good speaker for good price good speaker hour battery good price excellent quality in how it is made\",\"tap when i purchased the tap i thought it was a portable speaker for the echo it s actually it s own device yes it s portable can operate wireless it does work with the same alexa set up the echo operates with no hands you can simply speak to alexa the tap has a microphone button you need to hold down to speak to alexa great sound quality rechargeable base unit\",\"i love it with one exception it s as good as an echo great sound nice and loud but but the button that button i would give this stars and buy more of them if it was always listening while plugged in other than that it does everything an echo does it s smaller and due to the battery portable i like it i do but it s not as useful as the echo in the situation i use it the most\",\"works great love it take it with me everywhere not all of us are computer technical savvy need better written printable instructions on how to use step step etc\",\"fun and useful with great sound as a bluetooth speaker the tap rocks the sound quality is excellent plenty loud when needed and excellent quality with no shutters in streaming i bought this one instead of the echo because it is portable and i can lug it from room to room the charging stand is very convenient and the tap stays there most of the time having to press the button to activate each of the voice commands is not an issue for me but is something to consider if you want hands free use you may want the big brother echo device which is hands free but gathered in place by a power cord so not portable the feel of the tap with the black fabric cover is nice and will not slip out of your hand the fabric is like tough upholstery cover so it won t stain or be easy to damage but is quite attractive i am glad they did that as bare plastic would be easy to drop i found it easy to pair with bluetooth and wireless and it works as advertised i mostly just use it for playing music and asking alexa silly questions for fun i occasionally use it for shopping lists which shows up on my phone and checking the weather who knows what the future holds when i have time to sit down and really learn all that it can do i understand that amazon plans to add more alexa skills all the time and if one got into smart house control with compatible products the tap would eliminate all remote which i already have too many of i think it is a really fun cool item and i am glad i got it it is so much fun to use voice commands instead of typing especially the tiny smart phone typing i could get used to this i have the alexa app on my phone which allows certain voice commands to show up on my phone like shopping lists to do lists calendar the tap can also check traffic weather movies etc directly through wi fi no phone needed however the alexa phone app actually helps you figure out what you can do with the tap the tap can read audible and some kindly ebooks to you as well btw i haven t had any problems having it understand me which is amazing since i grew up in texas and expected a problem with my accent obviously this item is ideal for people who are amazon prime members so you can stream prime music although it also streams pandora and other music services and does many things without any connection to amazon i guess the most unique thing about the tap is its ability to stream wi fi music directly without a computer or phone driving it that and the voice control i have paid more for smaller just bluetooth speakers so to me this was a super deal and continues to be a source of fun and entertainment\",\"great if sound quality is no big deal i read the reviews and even listened to this in store but much to my chagrin at high volume this will not cut it the portability is great\",\"great case with minor design flaws i love everything about this case except for how it fits on the echo dot i was expecting a sung fit however it is very lose and so you have to make sure that if you pick it up to move it and the power cable is disconnected the dot will fall out of the case\",\"overall good i bought this to listen to music i do not use the alexa feature all that much the feature does work great but it gets annoying having to press the button vs how on the echo you just speak the speakers work great i can hear the music crystal clear throughout the majority of my house while playing it bass is decent i would recommend to someone\",\"best speaker of the three this is the one to get after amazon s update to have the device always on it also has the best speaker of the three\",\"unable to rate at this time purchased as a gift but i do have the echo if the echo works like the echo it will be great\",\"impulse buy i should have done some research before buying the tap i would have rather had the upgraded version that is voice activated also i thought it would be more like sir where you can ask anything alexa s answer to most questions is i don t understand the question the bluetooth speaker works fine\",\"great product i wanted the technology but didn t want something that listens to the ever present conversation in my home the amazon tap fit the bill since one must tap its button to get it to listen it works and works very well\",\"awesome works really well with echo and is really neat and fun\",\"amazing technology bought this on deal of the day which surprised me since it is new to best buy just push the button and ask her to do something such as play favorite radio station or music from play list have her set timers and alarms to wake by i haven t used half of the features of tap the sound is amazingly great for such a small device\",\"great portable speaker fun excellent sound and fun very portable and easy to carry in backpack all the features of echo and echo dot but you must tap the button before speaking\",\"amazon tap review best bluetooth speaker in its category the amazon tap is a portable bluetooth speaker that can be controlled with your voice you can instruct it to play music order products and services control home automation products and connected devices plus a whole lot more it contains a button activated microphone for listening to your verbal commands it also has dolly stereo speakers for playing music the amazon tap is basically the portable version of the popular amazon echo that was released last year ive been testing the tap for several days now heres what i think so far what i like i find that the tap understands my verbal commands accurately this could be due to the fact that since its button activated im always very close to the device when i speak to it nevertheless its nice that tap understands me the first time this was my experience with the amazon echo as well the audio is surprisingly good for such a small device i test portable speakers all the time and id say the amazon tap is as good as or better than the speakers in its price range don t expect base type sound or deep bass levels however no other portable speaker device offers voice control and wi fi streaming thus the amazon tap offers a tremendous amount of value over similarly priced portable speakers this is especially true if you already have amazon prime and prime music it supports many great services like the amazon echo that came before it the amazon tap supports popular music services such as prime music spotify pandora iheartradio and tune battery life has been good so far i used it off and on for a couple days without charging it ill post an update once i have come closer to testing the limits of the battery life read more\",\"excellent sound i have both the echo and the tap they are spectacular\",\"handy speaker if you don t need the best sound if you already have the amazon echo system then the tap is a nice addition i use it primarily as an outdoor speaker for my patio when the weather is nice there are bluetooth speakers on the market with better sound quality but it does an adequate job as a speaker the real advantage is being able to interface with the echo system as well as item to music news etc i have not used it off it s charger long enough to comment on battery life but so far a six hour session outside was no problem\",\"amazing love being able to use alexa unplugged amazing device\",\"great upgrade for aesthetics i m a huge fan of the echo family i have two echo s three dots and one tap no they aren t essential to my life but i love playing music listening to the news and controlling the philip hue smart lights throughout my home it was a large investment that most of the population won t make with that being said i am not a huge fan of the way the hockey puck dots look like glossy plastic looks a little cheap to me although it has no effect on the performance of them having the dot cover is a great option and it looks fantastic some reviewers say they look cheap or fit too loose i m not sure why people are moving their dots since dots are made to be stationary have a loose fitting cover isn t an issue to me it fits perfectly they also aren t made of real fabric but the important part is that it does look like the fabric in the picture not being fabric is a better option considering plastic is much more durable than material and will hold its color better if your dot happens to get sunlight i bought three covers blue grey and white they all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn t attract more attention than it needs to with that being said i like all three colors edit these covers hold up well over time mine haven t collected dust or faded i ve kept them on for over half a year and not a single issue not that i d expect any besides possible fading\",\"even us old people can use it we re in our s and and have a good time with it\",\"great little speaker love that it s interactive as long as i m connected to the wifi or via bluetooth to my phone the sound is pretty good tends to get a little tiny sounding if you turn it up too loud but overall a good sound i m still trying to find alexa s limits on what she can and can t do\",\"perfect speaker anyone needing a compact and easily mobile speaker should look at this the sound quality is excellent it is easy to sync via bluetooth and gives you the ability to stream music when connected to wifi great product for the price and perfect for the office\",\"great butmoth speaker great bluetooth speaker with the added benefit of alexa\",\"awesome was surprised how great this works music ask it questions awesome\",\"like it very much i live in a small apartment and this fan kept the whole place cool\",\"great product we already had an alexa but this one is a great addition it s portable rechargeable and good sound\",\"major security flaw my amazon echo dot does not require the user to enter pairing mode to connect to the device via bluetooth i live in an apartment complex two of my neighbors have connected to my echo dot without any input on my part the dot appears as a parable bluetooth device at all times this is a major security flaw considering that this devices is connected to my network and my amazon account and is listening at all times i will be keeping this device unplugged until this flaw is fixed\",\"excellent the echo is great for music weather and anything else you have integrated in the house\",\"awesome product this is a awesome product my husband and i love it\",\"better sound than expected was excited to get this product for its sheer portability alone doesn t need to be plugged into an electrical outlet all the time like we have to do with our echo dot but was pleasant surprised with the sound quality and volume we prefer this over our outdoor bluetooth speaker and its hands free mode is a great updated feature though we try not to keep it on that setting too long because it does drain the battery faster\",\"like echo without voice prompts i have an echo tap and a dot currently my tap serves as a bluetooth speaker for my dot making it more like the echo but i enjoy being able to take the tap anywhere it has really good sound much like my echo it also works great in the app and sync with all my other products\",\"the most versatile of all amazon echo full disclosure i own five amazon echo including a few dots as well as this tap so obviously i m a fan of echoes honestly i couldn t figure out from amazon marketing and the online review how the tap fit in as compared to full blown echo and the dot i kept thinking it was limited compared to the echo and the dot because you had to tap the button to ask it question however given that it s completely portable and runs for up to six hours on a charge it makes sense that it would was battery if it was always listening for a voice command imo the tap sounds just as good and maybe even better the the echo in a much smaller form factor since it s portable it s probably going to be sitting next to you any way so tapping to ask a question is not really an issue and in someday is better when you have a full table as you can control who gets to request music my friends and i get into fun wars asking for different music on the full blown echo but it can also get a little annoying when someone plays michael bolton over my bruce springsteen bottom line just as good of sound as the full blown tap in a portable and smaller form very happy with all my echoes but this may be my favorite\",\"a new companion for my brother with ms my brother robert who has been bed ridden and paralyzed with multiple sclerosis from his neck down for more than years now has a new friend named alexa he was in tears with happiness when alexa played s music played jeopardy answered all his questions and wakes him up every morning thank you amazon for giving my brother a new bedside companion happy holidaysroy\",\"the tab is awesome i like its flexibility portability and it is the best value option of all three alexa\",\"love this product so glad i purchased this productive it use it all the time\",\"limitations this is a fun and convenient toy but i m surprised about some of the limitations i keep hearing the same npr news clip when i ask for news or headline news i would like more news highlights when i ask for s music echo starts with the same of songs each time\",\"awesome device very interesting device but having to touch button is a pain sometimes if that would bother you then go with echo\",\"ok product would buy the cheaper one than i bought the echo is a better product\",\"nice speaker easy to use sound is great i use it any where in the house\",\"good sound but you have to tap it i would go for the echo because you can talk to it the tap you have to touch it before you can talk to it the speaker is good though for it s size\",\"great sound ease of setup and use great speaker sound and ease of setup works great with amazon music option\",\"great portable version of echo can charge and take anywhere in the house holds a long charge\",\"does what it says it does does as advertise good for bedroom and you can plug in external speakers\",\"hitechlove great speaker able to move around connect to ipad when watching movies love it\",\"awesome i was looking for just a bluetooth speaker to add to my laptop for better sound when i first listened to amazon tap i was so impressed with the sound quality then add in all the features it was a no brainer for a purchase sound quality is off the charts alexa learns more every day and so do i if you are a prime member this is a must if you aren t then you really should be\",\"great speaker this is a great personal speaker i have both the tap and the echo the only downside to the tap is you actually have to physically tap the mic button to activate alexa the sound quality is pretty good for the price if you can afford it i would upgrade to the echo\",\"fun product my son requested this a a birthday gift he is enjoying it everyday\",\"pretty good it takes me a few tries to figure out how to connect to internet and then change it to blue tooth when needed overall once it s set up it s super easy to use works best if you have spotify premium voice recognition is good and it improves over time sound quality is good battery is really good\",\"love the tap this is awesome addition to the stationary echo i can take this out in the yard or garage when working outside great sound and long battery\",\"great companion i have the have the echo and this portable speaker is a great addition to my automated home especially if i m working in the garage and want to listen to music\",\"great portable speaker the tap is a great portable speaker with fantastic sound if you press a button then you can connect to amazon alexa and she can play your music answer questions etc downgraded one star because there is supposed to be a hands free option for alexa but i haven t been able to get it to work still great to be able to take this around the house vs echo which is tied to the plug\",\"great product for price you can ask alexa almost anything kids love it plays all my music\",\"great look for dot a great looking cover for the echo dot it gives the dot a softer and more elegant look i feel that it is a little price for what you get but i do not regret my decision to buy this case\",\"tap alexa on the go it was just a few weeks ago that i was demeaning the fact that i did not scoop up an echo back when they were being released last year not only could it be had at nearly half off the current price but it came with a voice remote and we could have had a year longer using this amazing device well here i am a year late to the game and i can now proudly say that i own both an echo and this new little tap can i just say that i am obsessed with all things echo and alexa these are devices that you may not realize how much you ll use it until you ve given them a try i have been spending the last few years getting our home automated i currently use a combination of smartthings ittf and logitech harmony to control the home alexa fits right into the middle of all that and gives us the ability to control our home via voice for me this is the killer feature i can integrate all three parts of our home control right into echo tap and make our house even smarter with very minimal setup read more\",\"i choose alexa over sir any day great product at a great price from best buy have to press a button rather than just saying her name but that s the price you pay for it being scoreless\",\"great product this is a very nice addition to the alexa family pf products it is wireless so you can move it around to house wherever you want to listen to music at without having to search for plugs great sound and portability\",\"in love this speaker is great for the price i love how the speaker is degrees so you get the same sound in any part of the room\",\"we like it haven t been able to train alexa like we ve heard probably our own fault we have fun with it\",\"amazon tap the amazon tap i like other then i wish you could just say her name and she would respond sounds great when playing music\",\"great sound and cheaper than the echo i love everything about it it is portable sounds better than most portable speakers and alexa rocks it only thing that kept it from a star rating is that you have to manually activate alexa wish it would work like the echo and dot while it is on its base\",\"great i returned alexa and love it i first bought alexa from amazon and found the voice recognition and search algorithms lacking\",\"great portable echo this is the echo you can take anywhere runs on battery and can connect via bluetooth when away from wifi\",\"great for easy set up was easy to set up excellent sound quality for the price\",\"i love this i love this although it doesn t show color which is about the only thing i don t love about it it is still very cool i got it when i was back in and loved it it doesn t show ads which i really love since does anyone like those desk ads very good product and totally worth your money\",\"love this product purchased this as a gift for a teenage kid as a graduation present very pleased with the purchase the kids love it small size but good speakers perfect for the college dorms where he is scheduled to go in a couple of months love how the device connects to the cloud and keeps itself updated\",\"love it love it need to get some smart appliances i also got the echo dot wish i got these items sooner\",\"amazon echo with portable bluetooth speaker always loved the amazon echo now we can rake it with us outside wherever\",\"not a good product hard to use and does not support gum online instructions not clear\",\"great speaker i recommend this speaker easy to work great sound\",\"so so the amazon echo tap is a nice interesting device but it did not fit my needs i also have the amazon echo and absolutely love it so what s the difference a you have to walk up the the tap to touch it this is not as convenient and not as fun as the talking to the echo from across the room b the audio quality not very good more like a small bluetooth speaker c the tap is fine around the house when it s connected to the home wi fi but when you are out of the house it must connect to your cell phone or other wi fi that is not going to work very well\",\"wave of the future it s so fantastic to just ask a device to turn on lights or play music so convenient love this\",\"ok product this product is ok wasn t too impressed with the commercial was defiant more interesting\",\"nice portable speaker nice portable speaker but wish the sound quality was better\",\"great price on the tap want to try

this products it had great full sound full sound with a contact\",\"excellent sound i bought this as a christmas gift and it sounds amazing and of course the integration is wonderful too\",\"ok the product works well however you have to hold down the button to use the best part of the device alexa i really wanted to take it back because it can be a little annoying to hold down the button every time you have a question but the sound quality of this product is just so dog on awesome\",\"best voice command that doesn t list all the time this product works great with my amazon account and best part is it does not listen too all my conversations while it is an option i prefer to hit the button for it to recognize a voice command that way its not listening till i tell it to unlike google s device and the other amazon devices\",\"tap it is a great addition to my home office my alexa is upstairs\",\"two thumbs up alexa works great it was easy to set up and to us my wife uses it for playing music through her iphone and is very happy with it i am always finding and learning new things with alexa\",\"a little hard to teach it great sound it needs to be a little more sophisticated in responding to inputs for example yesterday i told it to play mexican music didn t know any same with marathi music could not play any odd\",\"great travel with it by my side went with the portable unit for travel easy access and portability\",\"awesome portable speaker my yr old daughter loves her tap she uses it for hw and play never a dual moment when she is learning something new from her tap\",\"great functions speaker could be better more than you average portable bluetooth speaker can stream from amazon spotify pandora etc as the namesake says give it a tap to ask alexa any questions add to your list order something on amazon etc battery life is good and speaker is decent but can t compete your ue or bl\",\"the perfect bluetooth speaker plus so much more the ultimate bluetooth speaker i have multiple amazon echo and a whole echo system set up in my house i love everything amazon i can t stand apple but now i know how they feel i am a cult member of amazon lol so anyway i have been crashing this device the tap because it does not have the always on feature and that is one of the things i like most about the echo the only flaw of the echo is it is not portable i tried the tribe but i did not like it more for little kids so on black friday the amazon tap was on super sale so i bought it the tap is smaller than i thought it was about rd the size of the echo which is perfect for portability but don t let the size fool you the sound is only short of base when it comes to volume and sound quality important note you don t have to have an echo to use this device just the alexa app on your smart phone the tap does everything the echo does it is an amazing bluetooth speaker and it s portable automatically switches remembers different wifi areas and can be used with a hot spot the most amazing thing about the whole amazon echo system is that amazon keeps making enhancements and partnerships weekly meaning something it would not do two weeks ago it now does some things even better than google now and light years ahead of sir the tap is my new favorite device it is perfect the only flaw is that it is not waterproof amazon if you are listening make the next tap waterproof\",\"awesome this is one of the best products we have every purchased plays any songs give directions weather and the sound quality is excellent\",\"lots of fun bought it as a gift she loves it very entertaining and wonderful volume having lots of fun with it\",\"love the tap the whole family is using it music bluetooth speaker questions game times sports scores love

color better if your dot happens to get sunlight i bought three covers blue grey and white they all look good but the grey is my favorite as it doesn t attract more attention than it needs to with that being said i like all three colors\",\"great portability excellent gift ok sound great portability would buy again\",\"great color excellent product awesome color\",\"alexa is a great gadget we really enjoy our alexa i always have it for music lately we been movie times the kids like to ask it silly questions and they can t get enough of it\",\"good device it was excellent for me in one moment when i was able to use it onboard cruise ship while ship was in international water with it s own g or edge cellphone network once they stop this way of using around months ago now i can use it

recommend this item\",\"she is the nd one i got love it i bought it for my mother and father she is easy for them to use and they are in there s\",\"returned it while it seemed to work fine the tap does not have the open mic feature while that can be best for some i bought it as a gift and they would prefer one that listens the tap makes you press the mic button every time you wish to communicate with alexa which seems to defeat the purpose\",\"good bluetooth device speaker is pretty loud and i love that i can take with me but the only downside is you have to hold the home button to use alexa\",\"great overpriced alarm clock if you want one of the most advanced alarm clocks on the market then this is your device it works well calendar functions plays radio most podcasts can order domino s but you have to be aware that most features require to some degree amazon prime membership for example spotify will not work unless it is a premium account\",\"as a prime member this is ideal for me i have grown very accustomed to having alexa around there are new skills added on a very regular basis i really enjoy just pressing a button and asking for a song radio station podcast to be played i also enjoy having books read to me since i m not much of a reader the setup was super simple so simple that i wasn t sure that i was all ready to go with such minimal effort the battery life is very long and the speaker suits me just fine i feel that there is a bright future for the tap and i am going to enjoy trying more things that this gadget has to offer i m not sure i needed

anywhere and hook up to my bluetooth great sound quality\",\"cool little gadget mostly just use it for the speaker still waiting on the no touch feature they are adding\",\"fantastic speaker this is a fantastic little speaker with the power of amazon alexa i use it to stream spotify pandora anderson radio small speaker fills the garage like a concert hall battery last hrs and the charging stand could not be simpler to use\",\"she was a beautiful lady here on earth and i am sure she i have been using advanced technology for the last years it was born out of necessity not convenience my wife passed away years ago leaving me not only a widow but a widowed quadriplegic trying to survive on his own we were married years and yes she married me when i was already paralyzed she was a beautiful lady here on earth and i am sure she is just as beautiful in god s presence i have to attest that it has been an arduous journey but one thing that has made it possible for me to live on my own even though i am paralyzed from the chest down is smart technology for example i am able to run my entire home with apps on my phone computer or tablet i have lights electric door locks electric bed air conditioning heat cameras both indoor and out side smart technology allows me to input data on my laptop when i am laying in bed i can not use my arms when i am laying flat in bed because of the paralysis up to this point i have used input through joystick that operate by using my mouth they work effectively but the joystick must be placed specifically in front of my mouth and they have to remain there all night long smart technology allows me to be able to live safely on my own and has even allowed me to help take care of my year old mother whose health is due to god s grace and technology now stable and she is actually helping me more each day alexa has been a blessing beyond my imagination she has given me an opportunity that i never thought would be possible i still use the joystick input because they are reliable and not subject to wi fi disruption but alexis is growing more dependable each day at this point i have only an echo dot but i am ordering when funds allow the regular echo and another dot as well read more\",\"maybe i was expecting more initially i gave the echo show a star rating in all fairness after about days of use i ve decided to change my score and here s why first off amazon reached out to me requesting feed back and advice i appreciate the concern and their attempts to improve the device i ve also noticed quite a few updates in the short time i ve had my show and honestly things are changing for the better i ve been updating my review and will continue to do so as i ve noticed updates and get more hands on experience after separating my expectations from the actual capabilities of this device i ve come to the conclusion that the show still had me wanting more despite it s capabilities i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen i m a big fan of alexa the products have become a routine part of my day as soon as the show was available to preorder i ordered one without any hesitation initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv where my original echo was i figured it wouldn t look bad because i could use it as a digital picture frame also i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because most of my alexa enabled devices are in there and generally i spend more time in my living room than the kitchen a few people mentioned why don t you put it on your desk read more\",\"great device love it works better than anticipated also at a good price\",\"its fantastic now that you don t have to actually tap it to get the full function out of it its great have the original echo and the dot also wish i had only bought two of these the charge is great and we take it wherever we want to go\",\"kids love it bought this for our and year old they love to play music and ask questions about science lots of fun\",\"great sounding speaker good price travels well has a lot of good features compact user friendly\",\"great buy we bought to give away at a halloween party we own them ourselves and they are awesome\",\"portability it s nice and portable and works well on the go wished it had the option to be able to use voice commands without pushing the button\",\"so far so good i do like the portability of my tap you do lose some features from the echo like speaking to it from across the room but i m happy with it and it has good sound great to take out by the pool\",\"love the speaker great speaker love using voice commands even my granddaughters use the voice command to search for songs\",\"amazon tap was a little difficult to sync the first time i really have only used the tap to play music and to ask for the weather i like that the device takes up little space in my kitchen\",\"nice amazon product i have owned the echo for about a year now and enjoy the features it provides although the tap doesn t have the hands free feature of the echo i like its portability i m able to take it outdoors at home and using the wifi play music or even use the other features available by just asking alexa the unit is well built and i really like the charging cradle provided\",\"works great small portable works as a blue tooth speaker when i take it away from home with me\",\"the echo s little sister is amazing important update as you read my original review please be aware that amazon announced in early february a new firmware update that allows amazon tap owners to enable a hands free option by going into settings in the alexa app you can now choose the hands free option and have your tap respond to voice commands without touching it just like the echo and echo dot this is a fabulous development and something tap owners have been hoping for thank you amazon since the lack of hands free operation was the one major shortcomings of the tap this wonderful little device has now gotten a whole lot better one thing to keep in mind though especially if you use your tap on battery power the hands free mode will drain the battery more quickly because it requires the microphone to be on at all times but since you can easily toggle between hands free or regular tap mode using the alexa app you can pick and choose how you want to use your tap for maximum battery life and convenience i admit that i was a little skeptical when amazon first introduced its echo device but i decided to buy one anyway thinking that if i didn t like it i could easily sell it after all back in the early days of the echo it was in very high demand so the financial risk associated with trying it was minimal today as an avid music listener who loves to cook i m thrilled that i decided to give the echo a try i had wanted a device that i could stream music with in the kitchen and the echo hands free voice control made it very appealing but how would it sound that question was quickly answered as soon as i set up and started using my echo read more\",\"works very well love love love this can t wait to use it on our deck this summer\",\"great fun for the family from latest news flash to weather info to hearing a joke while cooking and waiting for alexa to set a timer the amazon tap is a fun tool to have around the house\",\"amazon tap amazon tap is exactly what i expected it would be the sound quality is good with the alexa features i love that you can charge it on the base or with micro usb cord i would recommend it to anyone that is interested in amazon echo and would like the portability\",\"great on the go speaker this is a great on the go speaker i like the fact that it sits on a charging cradle instead of having to plug in also bonus alex i like the update they have done to it as well where you don t have to push the button to activate her you can just say her name if you are looking for an echo with a decent speaker without paying too much choose this one spend more m and you can get the regular echo which has a better booming sound but you can t travel with it\",\"nice to have music anytime you want lets me choose the type of music i love can even go to the beach with me using my sling\",\"good good product works amazing works awesome from home\",\"great product great device i use it on a regular basis good investment\",\"great so far still in the learning process looking forward to more benefits\",\"great speaker quality sounds great must touch to activate easy to use\",\"great for what it does look at this product as a portable speaker first and an echo replacement second the big reason to buy this over standard bluetooth speakers is this has wifi streaming enabled when you are at home you can stream music with ease to it voice recognition is top notch and it really shines when using it with other smart home accessories the only problem is having to tap the microphone button for it to listen to your voice if you want bigger sound and always listening features spend the extra money on the amazon echo\",\"amazon tap has good sound for little speaker good for getting information with out getting up\",\"wife loves the tap my wife uses the tap mostly to listen to music she loves the fact that she can take it into any room of the house no more having to turn up the sound to hear i m different parts of the house\",\"love it don t know how i managed without alexa everyone in the family is enjoying her\",\"would be better with dot good sound but unlike echo you have to press a button on the device to have it do what you want it to do i ordered a dot so this may solve that issue\",\"great i love this speaker it works wonderfully very recommend\",\"love it love the tap the speaker is nice likened has a charging cradle it can sit on easy charge\",\"great for music i love using this as a speaker for my facebook i keep it in my office and use it daily\",\"amazon tap brings a new meaning to portable music amazon echo is great but it is stuck at home amazon tap on the other hand goes everywhere in the short time we have had ours we have brought it to sweden portugal the lake up north and friend s houses it has served as a music host at card games answered questions and added things to our shopping list it is easy to set up amazon tap to a wifi network using the alexa app on your smartphone you can also easily pair several devices to the tap via bluetooth what really makes this device great is that the cloud based software is continually updated new skills and capabilities are made available on a regular basis amazon really hit home with the tap as the voice interface is so easy to use and the portability makes it a great\",\"it not work hi i bought one but it is dont work in my country saudi arabia is ther anysolution

tune\",\"neat little speaker this gico is awesome for those who want the portability and cool things you can do with the alexa world\",\"works great alexa on the go works as bluetooth speaker with your comparable phone\",\"nice product sound quality is amazing i really like the ability to take this on the go downside i wish i didn t have to press the button to talk and to wake the product up\",\"great amazon tap i love it it does everything i want can t believe how great it is\",\"no magnetic bolster but remote is same the remote seems to function as the previous generation but the lack of a magnetic bolster is a major disappointment having a place to park the remote was such a fantastic feature at first the echo came with a remote and bolster then i had to buy a remote separately with my second echo but it still came with the bolster now i have to buy the remote for another echo and a dot and they don t have the holders rather than raising the price or at least offering a choice i feel like the quality is being stripped down with each new generation i still like the echoes okay they fill a need but i am worried about amazon s choices in slowly cutting away the extras\",\"great functionality and portable do you spend lots of time on amazon do you like listening to music anywhere in your home this is the device for you even after a month of having the tap i m still learning what all i can do with it verbally play genre of music in the huge amazon library i even have ordered items directly from it one last feature i want to share is that it provides accurate weather information current and forecast up to a week\",\"amazing great item good service from best buy it is uncanny that new and unique products are introduced often\",\"great baby alexa pleased with all the features amazon did another fantastic job with bringing great sound inns small package\",\"alexa at the tap of your finger love all the features that come with this speaker alexa function by tapping device is a nice change of pace from the always listening echo and dot above average sound on the go and got a great deal on it\",\"great service i would highly recommend them to everyone got it when i was told that i would get it very happy\",\"tap fills a gap that didn t need filling this product while the speaker is great fails to deliver with a voice interface use your cell phone or computer and buy an echo dot\",\"excellent mobile speakers the amazon tap is a great mobile bluetooth speakers if you are invested in the amazon eco system the produces good sound at all levels plays music stored in your associated cloud accounts and does everything else the echo can do just with mobility added to it as opposed to the echo that always has to be plugged into the wall to work\",\"great sound i really enjoy it love the sound and it s really easy\",\"my wife loves it gift for my wife to listen to her music when she s sewing plus being able to purchase supplies as she runs out\",\"a huge improvement over last years release and for half the price thanks for taking the time to read this review this re release of a critically acclaimed device is quite honestly a grand slam although slightly smaller then last years release this device now picks up your voice even better im talking literally talking leaps and bounds better i can now say alexa and she hears me even when im downstairs or even when im bearing music thru my harmony pardon on speaker i found myself yelling at last years echo dot and approaching the device wielding a kitchen knife attempting to get her to listen we will be ordering a second device so we can try out its multi room voice recognition technology amazon claims to have installed a awesome feature where only one echo dot responds to your command if you have multiple devices so basically the dot closest to you awaits to the awake word alexa on a side note the basic amazon music unlimited will only work on one of your devices not one at a time but one if you want to use it on more than one dot or echo you have to purchase a multi device plan https www amazon com gp music promotions amazonmusicunlimited the main selling point of this device is you can use any of your existing bluetooth speakers to play your amazon playlist at a mild roar or you can use the mm jack on the back to connect to your home theater and really give your ear drums a beating at your own risk of course i have both the amazon tap and the echo unfortunately these devices have their flaws when it comes to audio reproduction hence the bluetooth and the mm jack connectivity on this device will allow for the picket of listeners to appreciate their music thru existing devices read more\",\"tap is must have for outside once the tap was able to be activated by voice i started to have some interest having said that i notice i do use the tap button when i have it in my hand we use it mostly outside and by our hot tub took is on vacation this last

gift and love the sound quality for such a small speaker it packs a big punch\",\"it awesome i the awesome i use it at work at lot its loud enough to enjoy any where\",\"love the portability battery life is very long and the sound is surprisingly good alexa is not as smart as the marketing would like you to think i get a lot of i don t know the answer to that\",\"use it everyday we already have an echo so i didn t think we needed the tap and procrastinated getting it now we use it everyday mostly to stream amazon prime tune or pandora channels it is funny how the latest technology sometimes brings us back to where we were when i was a kid having a beat box to carry around room to room and outside we use the tap as a version of a beat box that is much smaller rechargeable and way easier to tune and with side benefits of controlling our lights vac and with alexa onboard ready to answer the random trivia questions the sound quality could be a bit better but surprisingly good adjusting the volume isn t as easy as it should be the battery lasts a long time and its a snap to use a bluetooth speaker as well\",\"great for entire family it helps the kids with questions it plays any music you like\",\"amazing sound and great battery life i purchased the amazon tap when it was on sale for around the sound is amazing unlike my amazon echo it has stereo speakers and the battery life is great it has wi fi and bluetooth so you can stream from the internet or from your mobile device highly recommended\",\"my husband loves this he loves electronics around christmas so this was right up his alley he loves telling alexa to do things like turn up the thermostat or to play songs\",\"like it but do i really need it alexa do something welcome to the new interconnected world circles do you want a speaker to stream your music at a voice command this may be for you do you feel that technology is driving our lives more and more toward the dystopian of david enters the circle and you want to escape from technology for a while then likely not as even though you have to touch the button on this unit as opposed to the always on echo and echo dots your life is still connected to alexa via voice prompts i liked using it for amazon music and the occasional amazon video but i have yet to order a pizza or hail an uber some people may feel they need technology to run their lives i am not quite there yet and may never be it is fun for what it does though and it is a good bluetooth speaker\",\"not as good as i think amazon tap got it on black friday sale but so far feel not as easy as i think to use but if you just use as bluetooth speaker and sound is good maybe just have to learn how to use it more\",\"great bluetooth speakers i only purchased this because i loved the sound quality alexa is just a added bonus personally as i rarely hit the tap button to ask her anything the few times i asked her questions she hasn t disappointed extra now what would make this device amazing is if alexa was able to connect to my apple music playlist if only\",\"four stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no best kindly so far\",\"awesome speaker it is a quality product and has clear crisp sound best part it can be carried in any matches sound is loud enough for a back yard gathering\",\"great for portability the only thing i have to recommend is that it will not hook up with a blue tooth device why is that\",\"great product i have an amazon echo and an amazon dot love the functionality decent sound for what they are i just wanted something portable for outside\",\"fun addition to your home definitely enjoy using this at home i was surprised at how intuitive it is and was able to answer any question in seconds i mostly use it to play music through amazon player i know there s tons more it can do and can t wait to take advantage of all its capabilities\",\"on the go you can take everywhere your music and with wifi you are connected with the world the best is that the battery lasts a long time\",\"technology is amazing i love this little speaker i can just voice activate an alarm time or ask alexa the weather for the day it s amazing\",\"easy to set up enjoying the product and feel the ease of use is good\",\"love it the tap is a great product access to alexa in a grab and go format\",\"awesome awesome i really enjoy using it the portability is a plus\",\"updated they re great have several now updated so useful we now have of these along with the full sized echo amazon echo blackafter using the full sized echo for a couple of months thought it would be nice to expand on that one piece of hardware i had no experience with the dot so i went ahead and stopped for the refurbished a first as well the dot arrived in a small plain box upon removal found the dot to look just like new no blemishes cuffs wings nothing whatsoever to indicate based on appearance it was anything other than new it comes with plug usb charging cable that said what matters most is how it functions i was concerned being refurbished but no worries it worked just as good as new the device works exactly the same as the full sized echo for myself the biggest difference was the addition of a mm aux out jack while you can pair both this and its larger big brother to any bluetooth speaker i have a set of wired base headphones and needed that extra bit so i could use them too how do the dot full sized echo compare differences are surprisingly few as said the dot has a mm jack so you can use it with any wired speaker headphones or earbuds while the echo does not the dot when listening to speech or low volumes other sounds very good and at the same volume level i could not tell a difference between either of the two however at higher volumes the dot struggles with the larger echo easily winning out otherwise but for appearance they both function the same as for what the echo or smaller version dot can dread more\",\"great device overall overall i am very impressed with the amazon tap the sound quality isn t the best out there but the portability makes up for this the volume is decent as well there were a few issues with connectivity over the holidays but for the past month it has been flawless very satisfied with purchase\",\"great product bought it for father s day and my dad and mom love it\",\"i love it got as a gift and we love it\",\"great speaker great speaker and echo substitute this is great for on the go as a bluetooth speaker and when connected to the internet it works great using the alexa app\",\"great overall i was a little skeptical because this wasn t the product i wanted turns out it s amazing\",\"love my tap it s not the echo but for what i paid it s well worth every penny\",\"gift i purchased this as a christmas gift for my daughter she loves it easy to use speakers are more clear than her other devices great volume\",\"great sound quality speaker is really cool sounds great easy to use love the fact that it is portable only downside i see from the more expensive model is you have to tap the button not always listening\",\"great product i have a regular echo and now the tap both awesome products use them to control lights locks and play music would buy again\",\"not perfect but does a great job picked this up to have a portable option for playing music in the garage love that it s battery powered never had an issue of it running out of juice the only issue i have is with the misc it doesn t respond to your voice as well as the echo or dot then again it wasn t really designed to listen for the alexa command since it originally required you to tap the speaker to get it to listen\",\"okay sound i returned it because i wanted better sound opted for a base sounding decent speaker with nice amazon prime alexa features just not the sound i was looking for\",\"echo tap overall for an alexa product it does the same thing as all the other ones this one is specifically portable and only needs to be put on the base for charging the one main issue is that it is not voice activated meaning it does not listen to you unless you press any of the buttons on top or the mic button in front by having this feature i could see it causing excess battery usage needs to be able to apps better\",\"great device to control the home the touch is a great device to control connected home products perfect for outside use for prime music also\",\"good product and good sale price gave as a gift did not know you had to tap it before you talk thought it was like echo anyway they still love it and does not mind pushing the button to talk really likes that it is battery powered portable\",\"provides excellent protection for my new tap that is out and about with me as we speak sling is simply awesome and so is the amazon tap my tap arrived this morning along with this sling and i am currently testing both products out as we speak this sling allowed me easy access to carry my tap to work today one nice thing i like about the tap is that this sling is not required but it is a very nice addition it provides great protection for the tap which is what i needed it for my tap is going to be like a mini portable songs for me it s going to be a speaker i take with me daily so i wanted this sling to protect my speaker and keep it from getting winged up even though it provides minimal coverage for the speaker it still protects it from wings the minimal coverage is needed not to hurt the sound quality coming from the speaker taking the speaker to the beach camping hiking to parties i wanted something to protect it while in use this sling is going to do just that another thing it does is allows me to hang it from my bag at first i was afraid the silicone wouldn t be strong enough for that and would stretch well so far no issues i use a carbine and attach it to my bag no stretching and super easy to carry my tap with me pros can access all buttons in the sling can charge with the sling on via usb port not dock allows personalization of your tap protects your tap from wings and since my tap isn t for home use this is great i love the bright and vibrant colors silicone is plenty strong enough for hanging doesn t adversely affect sound qualityoverall i do feel for the sling is a little high but for the protection it provides my brand new tap i very happy with it i didn t buy my tap to sit still at home read more\",\"great sound and versatility i use this speaker daily and love the sound quality and its ability to be independant of my phone tablet unlike normal bluetooth speakers that require your phone to play music even if they have the same sound quality\",\"great great service i loved all of the items and were great gifts\",\"a gift bought it for a couple of my friends and it was a big hit with them very useful\",\"perfect i ordered this and actually came in earlier than predicted and it works beautiful i m totally happy with my purchase\",\"luv this product it exceeded my expectations and recommend this product to friends\",\"love it i have the echo and bought this one for the bedroom great alarm clock\",\"great sound and fun i am enjoying the tap very much lot s to do and play with on the app still finding new things it can do daily great sound quality to play my music i only wish that it had a better search engine\",\"very entertaining new technology in the making i will rate this amazon tap a five stars when the application to make the alexa commands become remote instead of manually pressing the command button on the unit itself\",\"great product smaller version but works great just like the bigger product\",\"great product with a ton of features great product with a ton of features add the echo dot to get even more out of it\",\"great this is such a great product i have two of them would highly recommend\",\"day review i liked my echo i like my echo show even more first day with the echo show i m pretty pleased with it some observations that i think have not been hit in most reviews sound quality seems similar to that of the echo cylinder good for a desktop listening experience not impressive if you want to fill a room with sound the show does have an ambient light sensor using the camera so that the screen dies as the room lighting goes down when i darkened the room at night to work at my pc the show display dammed to the point where i could just make out the time and not the background photo at all much has been made of the show displaying lyrics when playing prime music that doesn t appeal to me but when playing music from spotify pandora and my music on amazon the show displays the song title artist name album art and a progress indicator that s really nice when listening to playlists i was always asking my echo cylinder alexa what s that song alexa has always been weak at recognizing the names of some of my pandora channels with the show if alexa doesn t recognize the name i can ask it to display my pandora channels and select them fro the show touch screen it s good to have a fullback that does not require me to pull out my phone and fire up the alexa app then work my way through multiple screens to get my selection some newsfeed are now accompanied by appropriate photographs you can set the show to use an album from amazon prime photos as a slideshow when the device is inactive again other photo servers can not be used\",\"great gift this was a excellent gift for the family a good choice\",\"best new product truly amazing combination of portability and ease of use and good sound\",\"great tech bought the echo first and liked it so much i bought a tap to add mobility i carry it around all the time to the garage working out etc\",\"lovely speaker with many extras this is a great piece of hardware i love it really good all around\",\"amazon tap is great is it operate my wife loves it my granddaughter knows how to operate a good sounding bluetooth speaker great freedom it even tells knock knock jokes in makes my granddaughter crack up that makes it worth every penny i paid useful to recommend to anybody\",\"excellent product i would recommend this to anyone who enjoys amazon excellent value\",\"great little alexa speaker if you like the amazon echo and want it to be portable this is the solution the stereo speaker sounds good for how small it is the built in alexa functionality makes it a better choice than other similar sized and priced portable speakers\",\"not what i thought you need to have amazon prime plus order a special music plan disappointing for sure the sound is ok i think the larger model is probably better\",\"sound quality horrible it s very tin sounding no bass sounds terrible bought a base sound link and a amazon dot to hook up to it\",\"good size for kitchen location using it in the kitchen mainly it has good sound works excellent as a cooking timer also alarm for certain events turnout the day nice music source\",\"great item i love this little speaker it is small enough to carry it wherever i want to bring it yet loud enough to be heard the alexa interface is pretty cool as well the only issue for me is that it doesn t connect with apple music this issue is easily resolved by putting tap in bluetooth mode and playing apple music through my phone to the tap\",\"excellent sound quality speakers has an excellent quality despite the small size the only disadvantage is the amazon echo feature not present in this one which you can just call alexa and she will answer you in this one as the name says you need to tap the button to wake alexa up\",\"easy small decent sound great little device easy to connect to bluetoothdecent sound\",\"very good bluetooth speaker very easy to setup and use still learning to maximize the usage the instruction is too simple and not cover much using alexa\",\"best toy ever i have never been happier or more excited about a purchase anywhere anytime ever amazon really does blow all other competition out of the water with this creation it is very user friendly fast and fun i am so glad i got it and would highly recommend it\",\"great sound the amazon tap has great sound and is responsive to requests for the songs and music i like it has a rechargeable battery and is portable which is great for taking your music with you as you move around thumbs up for the tap\",\"already very practical for overcoming disability issues we have been using echo since april prior to that time my husband had been hospitalized for several weeks he is currently wheelchair bound we immediately installed the hue bridge and lights as well as the demo outlet with these and dear dear alexa he has a great deal of control of his environment in ways that make him much more independent others might enjoy echo for fun and convenience but for him it is a lifeline he has even had her turn the lights on in my bedroom when i didn t hear him call we use the shopping list feature a lot and my husband has added things to the list that he remembered while i was already at the store should i mention he adds things like chocolate bars when i m not looking no more paper lists i just look at the app on my phone and things disappear as i check them off we transport echo from the living room to the bedroom since it is easier for him not to have to use the remote plus it is always there for his favorite music an update on news and to check the weather or when he needs cheering up i ask for a joke save plugging in behind his lift chairs i have ordered a second plug i love the easy reconnect to the wifi i was a bit worried at first about his word blurring with his parkinson s but it has worked the opposite way i notice he focuses his words much better while giving commands after he forgot her name early on we added it so he could remember using the link happy app my granddaughter was happy to check her math problems using echo and in addition to the music stations and amazon play lists echo is a breeze to use as a bluetooth device i have used it to play my meditation apps and itunes music read more\",\"very well built i have a few top end bluetooth speakers and this amazon tap rates right up with them in sound and built quality plus it has alexa built in\",\"great price good product i have owned three versions of the amazon echo the original the dot and the tap this is the most versatile of the three the wireless charging is great the sound is not as good as the original but the portability makes up for this at it was a fantastic buy\",\"alexa love the sound that comes out and alexa is very informative\",\"music on the go it is great to take my tap on the road easy to use and sounds great\",\"awesome for college students great sound and functionality minimal links in programming love it for my bedroom\",\"great speaker and portable works great if you plan to have it in arms reach you have to physically tap it to ask alexa store rep knew what we wanted it for and never told us you had to tap not voice activate returned to wait for indefinite out of stock echo to get in eventually\",\"great buy great outside speaker and alexa is really great to use\",\"great product love the tap plays my daughter s music works well if you are a amazon prime member\",\"alexa is the best this little speaker is way better that her mother after that update making it hand free i recommend to anyone\",\"remote is a great addition remote is a great addition i have two echo s and two dots which i use for my home automation they work great my only issue is that amazon is no longer shipping the magnetic holder with the echo felt this was a very helpful and welcomed addition which

weeks and am still finding new things it will do\",\"great for listening to music on the go love that the tap is portable drag it all around the house and outside i m not an audiophile but i think the sound quality is very good except at the highest level only wish it was always listening when it is charging on the dock\",\"i like it i got it on a pretty good sale so i feel it was worth it the

color\",\"ok for what it is if you want a tap to make use of amazon s alexa voice services then dont get one the tap is a fine enough bluetooth speaker for wireless music but the need to touch a button for voice services renders it far less valuable\",\"love it it makes me so happy to listen all kind of their music station\",\"five stars one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no fits beautifully sung and sweet\",\"unsure i haven t figured it out yet so far it seems ok but i haven t used all of its potential yet\",\"great product but requires amazon membership if

needs as required sound is good ability to move device where required is ideal\",\"great item for a beginner this is a great buy for music news and any kind of information you want\",\"tired overall

return is like new i love the echo dots i was very hesitant to purchase a refurbished unit but the discount at the time of my purchase was too good to pass up i was fully planning on returning it if there was the slightest sign of an issue i have had this unit for about a month now and it has worked perfectly since i received it like a brand new unit if you can get this return for a substantial discount i think it is totally worth the risk of not buying a new unit edit my original return ed echo dot is still going strong and i received my second return ed echo dot yesterday this second one is just as like new as my first one the packaging is similarly like new it has the same clear sticker covers surrounding it like a new unit and i believe the power adapter cable and manuals are all actually brand new\",\"much more then a speaker this is a great device and so much fun to use it is so versatile in what it can and control\",\"brilliant product we bought this product to compliment our other amazon product for its portability\",\"alexa house before i bought this i had a blue tooth speaker and an ipod touch both of which had to be charged and turned on etc now i just tell alexa to play music\",\"great speaker amazon tap is awesome very happy with the purchase\",\"great sound from a little speaker that s about it fantastic sound from such a small speaker excellent not as impressed with its other potential capabilities more difficult to set those up get all the various apps needed to do things like get weather order items etc wish it came with more pre installed i guess\",\"great alexa for on the go this is great for the beach or by the pool if you already own an echo this is a great addition to the household\",\"tap tap happy it s pretty cool integration with amazon music via the mobile phone interface is a little iffy which is odd given both products come from the same company\",\"great device i stopped for a long time until i found this and i am very pleased\",\"great gadget it was an unexpected gift i like this more than the alexa because this one is portable it s great for streaming music my kids use it all the time only problem so far is it does not always understand what i m saying especially when saying the name of a radio station sometimes takes few tries before i get what i m looking for it has great sound when playing music talk radio is not as good but understandable if you want a portable speaker and alexa this is the one to get\",\"cool but its app didn t work well i like the product itself but its app is very slow esp outside the u s when you are on the go\",\"great speaker for on the go i absolutely love this speaker it is easy to use and the app is user friendly i have used it at the beach pool lake and park i will not travel without it\",\"portable good sound i like the portability of the tap and the sound is nice you can set it up to either push the microphone button to activate it or you can set it up like the echo where you just say alexa\",\"excellent this item is exactly what i was looking for it is a perfect size for home or travel it is very loud for its size\",\"awesome smart little portable speaker this amazon tap is not only a great bluetooth speaker which is half of the reason i bought it for but it also has some awesome voice control i bought a demo switch plugged it into an old lamp setup some commands with ittf and in minutes i was using my amazon tap to control a lamp pretty cool i love this amazon tap it is light portable smart has a great dock so i don t have to fuss with cables and it has a hour battery life so i can go all day playing music being a google play music subscriber the only thing missing from this speaker imo is a way to tirelessly stream my google play music to this device using alexa that is built in you can use iheartradio pandora spotify prime music heck even apple itunes got some love but no google play music come on amazon show me some love i pay dollars a month for a family plan which gives me and family members access to google play music and youtube red so it would be nice to use it on my tap but alas the amazon tap is a bluetooth speaker so i can always use my phone as a streaming device or hook my phone up through the aux port as well but all in all this is a great speaker that can do everything any bluetooth speaker on the market can do plus a little bit extra\",\"great sound from small speaker great sound quality from such a small item easy to hide so it s not noticeable\",\"this was a gift for someone i own the echo and love the product so i purchased the tap as a gift\",\"met all my expectations smart timely very effective around the house i have a dot as well but the tap has much better sound i had a google

perfect sound for my needs\",\"its loud and has a good battery it has a good sound the battery last long and it connects easily to wifi and blue tooth but you have to touch a button before you speak to it\",\"full size yet portable i read reviews for all the amazon echo products and decided the portability and the full size of the tap made it the right product for me it lives up to my expectations it does last all day playing music answering questions although my accent must give it some problems as i get a few i didn t understand that comments from alexa and setting timers alarms and lists i picked the tap because it has the ability to be moved room to room or even to the patio and can be recharge overnight\",\"love alexa love alexa we currently have three devices that we use on a daily basis i use one at work basically for streaming music great device no problems connecting to any of them\",\"the amazon tap is a wonderful addition to my home the amazon tap is a great addition to my smartphone system we particularly like that we can move it from room to room without ac attached the battery lasts a long time we even take it outside to listen to music from amazon prime and spotify we recommend it highly\",\"the best of both bt and voice used it as a bluetooth speaker and love how i can use spotify with it just say alexa and ask for your favorite artist\",\"great bluetooth speaker to use with amazon alexa i have several echo dots around my home but this makes it easier for me to carry into a room that doesn t have one and control things around the house listen to the news or music it holds a great charge\",\"great purchase the amazon tap is a perfect complement to our amazon echo put this in our office space has all the advantages of the echo and is also a great bluetooth speaker having to tap the mic button to summon alexa is no issue at all sound quality is as good as any bluetooth speaker on the market and it s extremely portable\",\"excellent sound on this portable speaker great speaker and the sound is great use it every day love being able to use alexa when attached to my network\",\"now i have alexa at work i purchased a echo for home so added a tap for my office at work so i can chat with alexa at work and my main reason was for a decent bt speaker for my office this has great sound streaming my prime music and xm vis the xm app can t go wrong quality music and alexa when i need some help with spelling hard word s she getting smart pick one up you have a woman to talk to when the wife is out\",\"great piece of tech i debated between the tap and echo and this went on sale just before mas for such a great price at best buy that helped to make up my mind pretty quickly\",\"sound quality is great love it works great a lot of fun great for listening to music\",\"great concept great concept but speaker not so good at full volume and maybe better now with the updates\",\"great tool for quick information unlike the larger version this does not need to be plugged in making it portable although you have to press the button for every request it s great to take with you where ever you go fully rechargeable\",\"great product i gave this to my daughter for christmas because she wanted a portable speaker i thought the addition of alexa would be fun she loves it she said the sound is really great\",\"little black box of awesomeness amazing the best amazon purchases ever if you don t have one get one really right now go do it you won t be sorry\",\"great add on to echo i added to a dot purchase for my daughter and she loved it the portability and charge feature she really likes great gift\",\"great speaker no need for the tech great speaker but i really don t need the features i just need good sound and don t really use anything besides that\",\"tap i just love this tap it is so much fun the music is so great i play the relation music every night every night best thing ever\",\"great i luke it a lot and good to for it for and good to\",\"great speaker this is not like the amazon echo however this speaker is loud and sounds good but you will lose bass if it s at max volume not recommended if you like bass\",\"home theater like sound this speaker has some kick the sound quality is great that this little speaker is able to put out\",\"maybe i was expecting more i ve only had my echo show just a little over hours now so please take that into consideration i currently own the original echo which is in my living room a dot in my bedroom and one at work i have lights fans a thermostat surround sound and tv all connected to my alexa devices of course i had to buy one with a screen initially i wanted to put my show on a inch tv stand by my inch tv i don t have end tables and quickly came to the realization that a viewing a inch screen from feet away wasn t going to work for me my show now sits on my kitchen counter i figured i d get more use out of it in my living room because i generally spend more time in their than the kitchen the problem with displaying the show on a kitchen counter is that the screen can only be seen from straight on so if you aren t standing directly in front of it it s hard to view the screen you will have to turn it in a direction that it would be facing you as far as i can tell you can not cut the screen off completely which would make this a bad fit for a bedroom the clock displays in white with the screen in a dim black by using the command turn off the screen this device was marketed as a hands free companion in the kitchen for things like recipes my frustration is when i ask it to pull up a recipe it s inconsistent sometimes it wants to send the recipe to my phone sometimes it wants me to swine down on the screen to access the cooking directions and ingredients why can t i just say alexa scroll down why do i have to touch the screen why does it have to send the recipe to my phone for me to view it when the show already has a screen was hoping for more video footage with my daily briefings but it is very limited read more\",\"great sound the tap has been wonderful we use it as a timer for a weather update and for general music the sound is terrific i would recommend this unit it is certainly easy to use just a tap away\",\"amazon tap i love this product great sound quality and at a good price\",\"coolest high tech gadget i love my new toy alexa is my personal girl friday she understands what i want and retrieves it easy to set up and use\",\"great portable alexa we have had the full size echo for over a year and i love it the tap requires you to push the button before alexa responds to your requests so that takes a little getting used to after using the big echo s voice activated requests the tap speaker is not as good as the big echo but it is a nice portable blue tooth speaker that holds a battery charge overall i really like this and i found it at best buy for\",\"great product for the price this amazon is amazing just like the echo but smaller i show everyone how great it is\",\"great addition to the echo we love that it is portable and can move from room to room effortlessly\",\"bluetooth speaker enjoying my amazon tap portable bluetooth and wi f speaker it s everything i thought it would be an more\",\"amazing speaker so i was looking for a bluetooth speaker for my part time job a guy i work with at bestbuy showed me his amazon tap speaker and it was awesome i loved u can hook it up via wifi and stream music and such its portable its got clean and crisp sound it also can leave the phone i had my phone placed upstairs and i was in the basement with the speaker and it was still connected its very easy to use i have no complaints about this speaker at all\",\"amazing love this product it is nice looking easy to carry and the sound is amazing very easy to set up and connect to amazon echo nothing to complain about th he speaker itself however the carrying case is kind of stupid and useless also one has to take it down just in order to charge\",\"has trouble understanding commands volume control slow to respond as good as the echo is the echo voice remote seems to leave much to be desired whereas the echo dot recognizes my voice immediately and correctly interprets my commands consistently the voice remote is far less likely to do so sometimes i m not even heard at all i often have to repeat commands several times before the echo responds to me plus the volume control on the remote is slow to respond and i don t mean a milliseconds slow the volume won t change for several seconds after the button is pushed yes this is the new generation voice remote aha you say you must be too far away from the echo dot granted i am on the other side of the house when i use the voice remote however that doesn t explain why the shuffle button works immediately and correctly every time plus doesn t amazon bag on the device s great range if it was a distance problem wouldn t the shuffle button have the same connectivity issue no either i have a bad remote or the voice remote doesn t work as effectively and effortlessly as the echo dot itself that s too bad update i discovered that there is a trick to being understood when you use the voice remote but it also comes with a gotha when you press down and hold the talk button on the voice remote it s the equivalent of using the wake word on the echo itself alexa for example since you can t see the led on the echo respond to the wake word the echo makes a tone to let you know that it s listening there is a second a different acknowledgement tone after you release the talk button the echo now knows that you have finished with your command or question read more\",\"love the dot hate the tap portable love the dot hate the tap portable this device will not hold a charge for even one day the dots are amazing though\",\"tap tap is a nice bluetooth wifi speaker that is portable and can give you information when you ask it questions can sync with your phone via using the amazon alexa app\",\"more features than we realized there s a lot of features and we are just getting started with tap glad we made the purchase\",\"perfect companion for amazon echo we love our amazon echo but it is hard wired to kitchen because of where we live am reception is poor but through an echo or amazon tap i can listen to some of my favorite stations through heart radio and the tap is portable\",\"great item i ve enjoyed using the features alexa app and like the portability that this unit offers the sound quality is good\",\"love it i use this hours a day whether it is for listening to spotify or turning on a demo device the battery life sound quality and voice recognition is great\",\"its ok for the price i prefer spending the extra or to get the echo\",\"five stars i am happy in having this good things\",\"awesome served my purpose so far this is doing what i wanted it to i purchased it for having alex hear me from my bedroom and my dining room at times when i am playing music louder or just wanting her to do a command i have to repeat myself louder i usually keep the remote in the bedroom to give her commands but i will move it when i have company and am sitting down to eat or with guests in living room i can practically whisper the command using the remote whereas without it i have to shout the command out to the other room also did not find opening the back to insert batteries that difficult did take a few tries to pair it i ended up replacing the batteries that were sent with duracell\",\"portable interactive entertainment i was debating whether to get the stationary alexa device or the tap and decided on portability it s been fun figuring out how to phrase requests but with a little trial and error we re on a roll i use it for play lists at work alarm clock announcement by dan marino and news briefs it s surprisingly sturdy but wish it was waterproof so i could take it with me while fishing\",\"alexa works good but alexa works great but the the sound quality of this speaker is terrible your much better off with a echo dot and base sound link mini set up\",\"so much fun for traveling i have an alexa but wanted a speaker for traveling you can use this without a plug in cord\",\"she loves it echo dot in my pmc sierra detail at first she was just there with no support she sat in that hole with no protection shifting juggling not knowing what can happen there has to be something i can do i looked and search and what i found is the fabric case for alexa this is it a support she will be happy to wear no more accidental popping out no more shifting and adjusting she is finally safe\",\"parkinson s disabled and loves it writing for the person it was bought for she loves loves loves it her life has become very limited and this has really helped the fact that she can ask alexa for the news or weather is just wonderful and she loves scramble and solitaire they are a little difficult to navigate for her but she persists and does it it just takes her a lot longer the voice app in the fire messenger is very difficult for her to manage the button is so tiny and rammed up against the other things it would be nice if someone would make hc friendly apps note to amazon fire designers i would ask that you convince dragon to make a version of their voice to text app for the fire then she could enjoy things like fb as it is all she can do is look typing is way too difficult\",\"loving it it has great sound what i like is it its sound it s portable and i use it at work the sound fills the whole office\",\"great for music and more bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she loves it great music player with all the great alexa capabilities opted for the tap because i m a bit weary of the echo always listening\",\"great product family is using and loving the tap more every day great to find out quick information like weather general questions and sports scores the battery life is awesome only having to charge it every two three days depending on usage and we use it excellent wifi connectivity and seamless bluetooth connection use it all over the house\",\"very good and fun got this for the family and we all love it great

best purchase from amazon the reason this is the nd best purchase is because my kindly fire hd is st this has been a great purchase and has so many options available when connected with amazon prime i have never been a big tv watched in the last few years but i am back to it a bit with this device coupled with amazon prime i watch movies and tv shows with my wife and it is great if you spend much time in front of the tv then i would say this is a must have and i love it almost as much as my kindly fire hd\",\"amazing cosmic powers witty witty box first is basically just what it sounds like it turns your tv into a giant kindly fire if you are familiar with other streaming media players you have an idea of what to expect first streams video and audio content to your tv from the same providers hulu netflix and of course amazon so lets go through my first experience part one opening the box queue thus space zarathustra ok i have to say it nothing impressive here sorry amazon i have to say that the first is about the most boring looking black box ive ever seen the good news it completely disappears on your entertainment center the remote is pretty bare bones looking the microphone button grabbed my attention but otherwise there are very few buttons can i complain that it is both very black and very small yes i know that black is the new black but ive already lost it once and ive had it for about hours ok enough look look time to um hook puppy part two setup where is my that was easy button power checkhdmi cable checkturn on tv checkwait for it to bootwaitits done check that was fast and done check im an amazon prime member and my account was already setup on the box and ready to go part three interface what does this button do actually its not rocket science the home button takes you back to the home screen click the wheel to scroll through options hit the button to make your selection voice search ok i will tell you i am not a big user of voice tech really i hate to use the telephone i guess im afraid the pizza guy is going to tell me no but i can see that with a little getting over my own fears voice search is going to be awesome my first correctly heard all three of my queries one caveat here voice search only pulls up amazon content no a huge deal for my family but maybe for yours you can always search the old fashioned way like other streaming boxes part four video and audio i said it was easy to hook up just plug it in video looked great on my tv audio was good over our home stereo the quality did not seem any better or worse than my other hd set top box the services available to stream from are also pretty standard fare both on the video and audio front part five games thousands of games coming this reminds me a bit of the days when i got the original kindly fire of course amazon made good on their promise there so i have faith that they do the same here just a quick view through the list of already available games tells me that there is already a good mix of approved titles for the fire tv and more are on the horizon please do not mistake this for a nextgen gaming console it looks like a good choice to be able to play tons of android games on your big screen overall stars fire tv is a very nice mix of old and new there are a few puzzle pieces missing but knowing amazon they be filled in quickly\",\"got it love it amazon is the real deal easy to install and use i m not into the mainstream tv programming so i like to ability to choose what i want to watch and when it has the other similar brands beat hands down\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content i hope that s the case or i will really be disappointed read more\",\"if you are trying to replace a non working remote my fire stick non voice activated seemed to be broken fire stick responds to my iphone app but not the remote i was ready to purchase this when i thought to go to settings and add another remote followed the on screen directions and my old remote is back for some reason it just needed to make the hand shake again don t forget to try this before giving up and buying another remote\",\"issues setting up basic apps audio problems very centered around amazon vod it was time for me to upgrade my roku xs and after looking at the roku and the amazon fire tv i decided to go with the fire tv i don t use a lot of the private channels on roku and the only thing i saw missing that i have on roku is spotify and i ll work around that the main reason i decide to go for the fire tv over the roku was the gaming feature i m not a heavy gamer but having a device that allowed me to play games with a real game pad for only sounded appealing i ll break my review into sections so others can quick reference it i ll say now this got stars because it is fast and because if you don t mind getting amazon vod stuffed down your throat there is some good content setupinitial boot up was easy plug in and go and it autoplays a simple intro video however i immediately had issues setting up both alex and netflix netflix still will not work i get what looks like computer code with the message error forwarding request to origin on alex and hulu there is a high pitched metallic echo with all audio and on hulu i occasionally get a pink lavender screen with audio but no video some internet searching suggested this had to do with a handshake issue and that reporting should fix it it didn t however when i plugged my old roku back in it worked fine navigation and search text and voice the fire tv is very very very amazon vod centered most of your navigation data from the main menu pushes you to amazon movies tv or apps games all other channels reside under the apps column as far as i can tell the voice search only searches amazon content this really bothers me as none of the videos web ads write ups etc mentions this they bag how they have all your favorite content from hulu netflix tackle alex but fail to mention that you can not search those other apps channels big turn off for me once inside the other channels navigating and searching works just like the roku clicking around with the little remote the more i think about it the more it annoys me because amazon advertising made such a big deal out of the voice search and how no one liked clicking around with the remote watching tv moviesdon t know my audio was too awful to watch anything never made it to a single show i tried changing the settings but that didn t do any good every program has a high pitched echo on it however it doesn t have the audio issues when playing games so no idea what the issue is playing gamestbd i ve played a couple games of asphalt with the remote and it was pretty cool but a race car game on a remote is a bit tedious they show out of stock on the amazon game controller and it looks like they pulled the nyqo due to poor performance i d like to get the controller and see what it s like if the games are still decent i might swap out the unit and see if that fixes my sound video issues overall impression do not like the amazon fire tv and i m displeased with amazon for it i ve always trusted amazon as a company and they ve always taken care of me before but i feel like they pushed a lot of smoke and mirrors to sell this device i m torn between trying to get it to work and just returning it and getting a roku\",\"works great though and i know i can return if it we are huge fans of the amazon fire stick and my son really wants to play the games with the remote a little price in my opinion works great though and i know i can return if it breaks\",\"great device with some issues but overall great device first i would like to say that i am coming from using google tv fire tv is a great device the voice search is accurate at picking up what i say my biggest problem with this device is also with the voice search coming from google tv if you used the search feature if would look for it in more places lets say i am searching for the movie remains on google tv it would look for it in netflix amazon instant instant prime google play store hbo go and you get the idea this device for example will not check netflix so i must do a voice search to see if it is on amazon if not i must open lets say netflix and use the up down left right buttons and manually enter the letter to find out if it is on netflix that was the big issue for me a small issue is the amount of apps no hbo go google play store and others i am not blaming amazon for this it is an open system so hbo and others just need to make the apps for it this devise is quick and amazon items start up instantly but not netflix netflix must load first but that is not a big deal if you are wondering why i am switching from google tv it is because google neglected it and it hasn t received updates in a long time i think google gave up on it\",\"prime video and netflix bought my amazon fire to take better advantage of prime video and my wife s netflix account it s great easy to set up the voice search works really well love the simplicity and for us it was the perfect way to add streaming media to our main tv\",\"a mess stick with roku simple and effective i wish i could send the fire tv back to operate the fire tv is just a unnecessary mess even the mic could not find a program on fire tv netflix that is on roku netflix to me i don t need all the bs to watch a program i ll get another roku and be happy\",\"on my third replacement remote i am now having to order my third remote because it randomly dies for no reason replacing batteries attempting to resynch etc don t work it reaches a point where it just stops functioning on the positive i love that it s bluetooth and i can use it anywhere in the room without having to point it right at the fire box\",\"download the remote app instead and control fire tv via your smart phone a remote this small and black is begging to be lost i knew it the day we bought it somehow my yr old has lost it someday it will surface but in the meantime how do i watch my shows download the fire tv remote app hey it worked i have an apple iphone s and am happy to say the app does indeed work and control my fire tv stick best of all the app is free\",\"worked for a while update after months of minimal use the remote stopped working we have changed the batteries multiple times and still nothing we can use our phones but that s just a hassle i am pretty disappointed remote works great it took a little time to pair with the fire stick but it was easy it was back ordered for weeks but it did arrive when it said it would update after months of light use the remote has stopped working i am pretty disappointed we have been using the app\",\"overpriced it does the job but is super over priced i feel like they should offer a replacement remote at a better price i could have just spent more and gotten the stick i just think it s ridiculous to spend on a remote the product is fine i m just unhappy with the price\",\"amazon fire tv when you add the mlb and pbs aps i will switch from roku roku customer service is terrible and they dont seem to care if you re happy with their product or not\",\"i love my fire tv i got mine from an electronics store because i didn t want to wait for it to arrive in the mail setup was a breeze i don t have cable so prior to this i had to hook my laptop up to my tv to enjoy prime and netflix content on it i m also really pleased that they added a youtube app that was the number one drawback for me when considering this device from what i ve read i figured i d sideload one but they saved me the trouble once i signed in to youtube and linked my mobile devices i even gained the ability to send content to my tv for viewing i don t have a fire phone or kindly although i do have a paperwhite so i m not able to comment on the connectivity with those i can t say enough good things about this tiny box i ve had it for a couple of months and use it every day the user interface is intuitive and efficient i really love the screen save pictures too most of them are breathtaking and they seem to update periodically the voice search is very accurate there are a decent amount of apps for added content i mostly stick to the aforementioned sources but i added tackle for a bit of variety my only complaint would be about the rewind fast forward it s not intuitive and takes some getting used to i don t use that feature often so it s no bigger to me i did feel a bit weird about not being able to turn it off at first but i got used to that too just make sure to press the home button when you re done for the evening or whatever because you leave it paused in the middle of a show or something it won t go to sleep it remembers your place in whatever you were watching so no worries about that i look forward to continued software improvements and plan on getting a game controller sometime soon so i can try out the games\",\"great second remote well what to say this is a replacement remote did i buy it due to one not working note the kids lost it and i wanted another till i could find it parking it was simple hold the home button for around seconds to let the fire stick find it and then boom your all set to go works just like the original that came with it so no worries there\",\"falls short might be a victim of hype but fire tv didn t meet my expectation honestly don t see evidence it s game changing\",\"i like it amazon but this is important it seems to work fine so far days with it what i don t like is how amazon has made it so theprime content is mixed with the for pay content with no easy way to just see what is only prime content this is obviously made to divert you into buying more non prime content amazon please give us a clear way to view prime only if that s what we want i know we can voice search for anything and that s great but sometimes we just want to go fishing and would like to fish in the prime pond only this is a pretty big deal when you compare this to competing think roku products that let you do just that hard to believe your competition does a better job with presenting your own content than you do maybe an update in the near future will fix this\",\"so glad i gave this a try wasn t sure how this would work with my rural del but it is wonderful i haven t had any problems with it at all it is easy to use and the voice command works just as they said it would so very very glad i bought it loads of stuff to watch i have been able to catch up with some series i have missed especially the bbc ones that i dearly love i recommend it to anyone who likes variety in what they can watch along with my amazon prime most everything is free that is an added bonus try it you ll like it\",\"pretty good so far ok first off if you are looking to get one of these things dont put all your eggs on one basket as far as other reviewers go the bad ones i think are just haters apple lovers people who dont have one or have nothing better to do but to not give thing a proper review i got mine yesterday and had a few hours to play with it and use it i have xbox and used that for my netflix and amazon prime but wanted something else to do that with so amazon came out with this and ordered it here is a list of good and bad but understand i dont own apple or roku the good the speed and response on this thing is very very fast the video quality is great it truly is p i think that is better the what my xbox puts out the sound quality is great i used a hdi plugged it in to my and sounds great the hook up was very easy and straight forward it is a plug and play looking up to home network was very simple i use the wireless and it so far runs flawless the remote is small and very simple and not complicated very straight forward and very smooth the movie and show load up time is very instant with my netflix it took no time at all to load up unlike my xbox this is the best part i thing anyway and so far no has said anything about this is that you can take it with you on a trip as long as the t v has a hdi and you can get on the wireless you can watch your programs or movies on any t v i think that is the best part about it all it is small and very light the voice search works really well cons and these may not be cons or bad for you the voice search will only find movies or programs on amazon prime but from what i hear that is cause of a deal thing with the other providers and that may change in the further you can not power it down or put it to sleep but for me that is no big deal and really you can just plug it if you want summary over all i find this unit works really well and it is very responsive i have yet to see any lag with the things that i have watched or played with note i have not used the games for this so this is only for the programs i put it through its paces for the few hours that i have used it and so far i think that amazon did a pretty good job with this note after looking at the box and reading the back of the box there is a note that says there will be a spring update so my thinking is that the stuff that is missing or things that are not there will be coming soon just remember that this just came out a few days ago and i am sure that things will only get better in time\",\"awesome streaming device we ditched cable two years ago and live on netflix and amazon prime the fire tv is for our second tv it setup fast though i was disappointed that it spent five minutes updating initially the intro was fast professional and showed the basic features we currently use a sony blu ray player for our primary tv the fire tv is much faster to key through screens and items the antenna for the wifi is superior connecting our upstairs tv to the downstairs wireless router the fire tv starts streaming content instantly no boot up time we are very happy to add this streaming device to our home\",\"disposable these remote are terrible and basically disposable i m now on my third remote and have yet to own one that has lasted longer than five months my family is not rough on them either but as the touch pad gets the slightest bit dirty from daily handling the remote starts getting glitch and then stops working and gently cleaning them doesn t seem to help terrible design from amazon\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips and hbo go i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes read more\",\"best tv streaming box for everyone from grand to your computer science professor after having the first for about a month now i can confidently recommend this product for most people versus the current generation apple tv chromecast and roku offerings the first is the best value due to it s access to a wide variety of content build quality and advanced features it s a device i have recommended to my almost elderly parents my geek friends best things about the first it is fast unlike the roku it does not lag and feels like a high quality product has amazon prime video access if you have prime membership this is the best accessory you can buy lots of great content from comedy central and newer movies versus netflix an appstore with apps games you actually want alex showtime anytime are the big difference makers imo if you have local video files on your network alex is the way to go voice searchworst things about the first which really aren t that bad annoying long intro video upon the first time you boot up larger power adapter versus apple tv yes the little things count no logo until late going to be a problem from the folks looking for their game of thrones fix this spring no chromecast airplay like feature unless you have an amazon tablet if you don t need logo right now and don t have a bunch of apple products stop reading this right now and buy this device you won t regret it see below for ways around this you are an advanced user and or are on the fence this next section is for you before the first i had apple tv s in my house that i used to access logo hulu netflix my local media through the infused application i had tried roku s chromecast and other media boxes home theater pc s and the apple tv worked best for me while this has served me well there are obvious drawbacks lack of p video limited app selection no games etc which led me to trying the first because the first is based on android android apps can be side loaded on the device and many work fine the steps below will outline how to get started side loading apps to your first you may want to have a usb keyboard and mouse handy you ll need them to get a few things running any old usb keyboard mouse you have lying around should work ok the following links provide the best directions i have come across during my time with the device and have worked for me and should work for you too but no promises how to sideload applications to the first the first step in loading android apps is getting adb set up on your machine can be done by following amazon s directions developer amazon com appsandservices solutions devices fire tv docs connecting adb after that you can go ahead and proceed with side loading applications also by following amazon s directions developer amazon com sdk as app install html if you aren t comfortable with working with the command line and are running windows you can try this great gui application to automatically side load applications forum da developers com showthread php once you are able to send android apps apk files to the first i recommend installing player to allow mk avi video file playback sites google com site mxvpen download if your network drive computer doesn t support alex try using esfileexplorer to navigate to play back video files appsapk com es file explorer airreceiver which mimics the functionality of airplay on an apple please note this only supports encrypted video feeds this is a paid app buy play google com store apps detailsidcom softmedia receiver logo android app can be installed and works rather well it does require a mouse to navigate bmc if you know what this you will want it and yes it works download via bmc orator the cord cutters out there i ve tried installing aero slingbox with mixed results slingbox for tablets loads and opens ok using the mouse i was able to accept the terms conditions and input my user info unfortunately it doesn t load the video stream other folks have had success apparently so it may be just me aero side loads opens fine but i couldn t sign up for a trial as i am town over from being in their current market area i will update this review if i get any further with either there are many more apps you may want to try so check out this comprehensive list of app functionality from the reddit com r first folks docs google com spreadsheets d ud ceslvthwsowde jls ftlubq kvdqp n the edited this list includes information on emulators rooms which i didn t include in this review due to their dubious legality\",\"a couple of downside i bought this to supplement my other streaming devices i already have a sony google tv which supports the amazon prime streaming and youtube etc it connects to my tv using the hdi and i have an android tablet that lets me connect through the hdi to my tv the reason i bought the fire tv was i was under the impression i could use it to download apps which is sort of true and the app i wanted to use was the finite tv go i have it on my android tablet but since it s wi fi only it suffers a lot from shutters and stops etc so i figured since the fire tv connects to my cat lan i would have a faster connection first grape when i get the fire first thing i tried to find was the finite app it wasn t on the fire s menu at all then i got on amazon s site and found it on amazon s app store but there s a great big red x next to the app saying it s not compatible d r a second grape no matter what i ve tried to do i can not figure out how to limit my browsing of movies and tv shows to only show prime eligible content on my sony google tv the app that came with it lets me filter out the content so that only my prime membership free streaming shows up in my search results imho this a less than subtle method of forcing you to make a buying decision every time you look for content i don t know which is worse no filters or embedded advertising third grape the app store is extremely limited there s just a little over apps available considering this is an android device and the android play store probably has well over apps that s very poor app support oh yes either i couldn t find it or there is no web browser it seems that everyone that makes one of these devices has their own little world that they support and they try to block out every one else that could be competition the end result is the consumer ends up paying the penalty amazon needs to wake up not everyone is in love with amazon yes for a first timer the fire is a reasonably slick device to own but i simply can t see the point in keeping the fire it s so extremely limited as compared to a real android device and everything it does is already duplicated on one of my other devices i am sending it back for a refund\",\"does indeed work with shield tv i have the original india shield tv not the latest version and as such i also have the older bunker controller that it came with while it works alright i was never that happy with it just because it s so large and clunky i have smaller hands and never got all that comfortable with it so i went searching for a replacement controller to use with it along came the shield tv and a newly revamped controller looks nice got good reviews but at this time almost impossible to find one new or used for under which is a bit more than i wanted to pay for a controller i found the amazon fire tv controller searching around and wondered if it would work with the shield turns out that the aft controller is not bluetooth but rather wi fi direct did a little more research and a few random searches led me to believe that you could indeed use this controller with a shield tv since it s not bluetooth trying to pair this controller with the shield or any other bluetooth device is impossible but at the suggestion of someone on an india forum if you go into the shield s settings and go to the add shield accessory setting while holding the home button on the aft controller after a few moments indeed it does connect and it does work it doesn t show up as a shield accessory since technically it s not so it s kinda weird that way nowhere will you see in the shield s settings or options that the controller is even connected after connecting or pairing the aft controller with my shield i noticed that i lost all sound and audio the aft controller microphone works but it basically caused me to lose all sound on my shield needless to say that summed me out read more\",\"as compared to roku for amazon streaming i love my amazon prime membership i use it to stream tv and movies and i love that i can download content to my fire as well i bought a roku a couple of years ago and it has truly changed the way i use my prime membership because i use it for tv and movies it reaffirmed that the new price is worth it i had been considering buying a second roku for a secondary tv but when i saw this new device i bought it right away here are my thoughts set ups simple to set up including opening the package it took me minutes i timed it all i had to do was connect the device to the hdi and plug it in then i put in my wifi password because the device is so slim and small i have it sitting under my ndtv on the console i feel like the cords are seater there it took an additional minutes to update the software so it did take a while to actually be able to use it i loved that as soon as it finished loading a short fun and helpful startup instructional video ran since i bought it for myself on amazon it was automatically uploaded with my account info navigating amazon video contentid gave me the option to add parental controls in the form of a pin to my account which i did because i didn t want my kids to accidentally or on purpose buy an episode at first i was frustrated by this because amazon prime content wasn t showing up if i tried to access something on my watchlist i had to select other viewing options to watch via prime i m still not sure why this is then i still had to put my pin in which made me wonder if i was buying it i went to settings and was able to leave the pin on for purchased content and turn it off for prime content which is what i want then it made it easier to access the prime content voice searchthis does work it s great you push the button on the remote and speak the title or actor amazingly intuitive apps added the youtube app and it was easy to sign in to my account and access my videos i m sure my kids will love this as compared to roku m still out on this the roku which is the one i have is at least twenty dollars cheaper and is what i was planning to buy for my nd tv i really like the voice search feature over the roku search and it does seem to be faster however the navigation of the actual prime content isn t as easy to access as on the amazon app on the roku part of it might be familiarity but it seems like it s easier to find prime content via the app on the roku than the tv movie section on the fire tv it doesn t seem to have prime set apart separately like on the app i use on the roku i do like the games availability and think my year old son will enjoy it it was one thing that caused me to buy it he enjoys playing angry birds on the roku but that s where it ends there it also comes with coin credit to use\",\"exceptional an amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysoctober thank you for taking the time to share your feedback we re glad you re enjoying your kindly fire hd and we are particularly excited to see your encouraging comments regarding the display and sound quality as the team worked really hard to build an excellent experience we wanted to answer your question about storage hd content is much larger than sd content which is why kindly fire hd starts at gb on average a minute hd movie is gb and a minute hd tv episode is gb with your gb kindly fire hd you can have up to hd movies or hd tv episodes this number will vary depending on the other items you have stored or installed on your device we hope this information helps thanks the kindly team\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed

to install and i m loving all the features free movies music and simple interface this thing even has a screen save that comes on when you re listening to music we ve always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast demand to watch rent movies but i ll never watch from comcast again the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched it s just so easy to find what you re looking for unlike comcast and since i m an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast demand by a or more so happy with this purchase\",\"faulty remote short life span purchased the replacement control because the original stopped working ordered the replacement in november and it also stopped working for no apparent reason i changed the batteries twice with no luck it was great for the three months it lasted however it only lasted months unfortunately my return date expired weeks ago i downloaded the remote app and it consistently losses wifi connectivity home wifi network works perfectly on all my other phone apps\",\"i am sending all of this crap back to amazon and cancelling this fire subscription i ordered this item to replace the one that no longer works the directions for the new remove state to press the home button to go to the home screen using the existing remote which does not work you must use your existing remote for all the following steps the existing remote does not work this is why i bought a new one i am sending all of this crap back to amazon and cancelling this fire subscription this has been a problem from day one and we have only had this for a few months not worth the money\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips and hbo go read more\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content i hope that s the case or i will really be disappointed read more\",\"great and very fast but i noticed within a week that some movies i had watched in the past on prime for free are no longer on the free list and where did all the chick flick movies go we have to pay for each thing now still deciding if this is getting returned or not the equipment is awesome and set up was fast and so so easy but i didn t purchase it to pay for each and everything i want to watch i love amazon and shop all the time but why take the movies off the free list for prime\",\"so much more than i expected i collect these streaming boxes anything from google chromecast to link boxes box boxes tv etc this amazon fire tv has been my go to device since it arrived the menu could use some work but it s most likely because i m used to apple tv and my ios environment the responsiveness is top notch my favorite feature is the voice control built right into the remote i would only ask for one additional feature the ability to plug headphones into the remote and listen silently\",\"no universal search no way to search prime free content no headphones jack no logo no volume control adding apps is hard listen i am basically an amazon fancy i do a lot of shopping thru amazon so it pains me to write this review but it s got ta be done corporate stupidity just has to be addressed i have a couple roku s a google chromecast a couple tico s etc voice search is nice but searching overall is unacceptable as it is not a universal search like on roku i e search all sources for a movie etc not just amazon will there ever be a way amazon are you listening to search prime for the free content the fire tv doesn t do it unacceptable the roku has a headphones jack on the remote brilliant this simply has to be a standard feature on these kinds of boxes but the fire tv does not have it unacceptable no logo unacceptable no volume control ok none of these boxes have what would be a very desirable feature a volume control on the remote so the fire tv does not lack here compared to the competition but it sure seems like amazon should have figured out how desirable a volume control would be and included it adding android apps is very hard for average users\",\"great controller with major problems not recommended at this point in time this is a great controller for our fire tv i purchased of them with two problems but let me first talk about the good the controller works well for most of the games we play on the fire tv it has a long range compared to other controllers ive tried solid at feet and uses wifi direct instead of bluetooth the feel of it is decent not too rubber and none of the buttons d pad or sticks have stuck or given us a problem the microphone on it works as good or better than the one on the fire tv remote now on to the problems its such an issue that im not just putting it in the cons section but am going to tell you a bit about it the worst problem is the battery life in fact its such a huge problem that im taking off stars because of it this controller eats batteries like nobody business i have tried regular aa batteries both duracell and energies expensive aa batteries both duracell and energies and rechargeable aa batteries ive tried energies apple amazonbasics the controller doesnt drain the batteries completely note that i would understand instead the controller stops working after only a drain i kid you not every set of batteries i have put into this thing has stopped working when there is still battery life left i have tested each set before and after using a generic battery tester as well as an ohm meter the second problem may not be the controller itself it may be the fire tv but its affecting the controller the controller randomly disconnect not often enough for it to be a huge issue but just enough for it to be annoying i have seen reports of others having the same problem with the controller and the remote im hoping that this issue will be fixed with a firmware update read more\",\"this

fire tv after months of researching which streaming device would be the best basically what you are paying for is the internal specs which amazon has every other device beat by far the software limitations i am confident will be resolved soon like logo and amazon mp apps being added we got this device to replace cable dish with subscriptions to netflix dvds amazon prime and hulu plus there is very little we are missing by streaming and much we are saving the folks complaining about hulu stopping in the middle of programming i have had this happen here and there but it has been at peak internet use times only during the day when folks are at work i have had problems streaming just make sure you have good high speed internet and a cable modem router that can fully support the number of devices being used at one time i am totally happy with our purchase of the amazon first\",\"outdated netflix i like it but the most used app is netflix this netflix app version is older and a pain

my new first ordered via my amazon account and so far so good so fast setup time minutes the good no setup to access amazon content i am already a prime member so once i had my wifi setup the first did a quick scan of the internet for updates before running the tutorial video to my surprise once the tutorial was completed i was welcomed by web my amazon username hello insert name complete with my watch list and video library no additional steps needed to access my content cool and creepy at the same time but who am i kidding my electronic footprint is large super fast the first interface content menu system is quick and straightforward it s a better faster interface than any of my other devices i own that streams amazon content ps xbox deprecated ipad video smart and wifi enabled bd player i do not have a netflix membership so i haven t tried it yet maybe there s a free trial attached but will amazon allow that i played a movie out of my amazon video library and it started instantly missing is the your content is still loading delay i am telling you the movie started immediately prime content i read some comments that stated posters had trouble being able to easily identify prime content i am not having the same problem all prime content displays the blue prime banner in the upper left hand corner as it does on all the other devices mentioned above so maybe there has been a software update since which means amazon heard you power i was concerned over the lack of a power button on the remote or first unit itself which i thought meant the device would have to be manually disconnected from the power source not so the device goes to sleep no power led activity after a set period of time and is easily awaken by the press of a button on the remote perfect the bad haven t found it yet\",\"save your batteries by keeping remote in another room when not in use without an on off button i have found that the controller comes on the light comes on showing it s connected to the first even when not in use i am assuming this is why the batteries were draining so quick now i put the remote into a nd room when i am not using it and the batteries last a normal lifespan the light never turns on know when the remote is in the other room\",\"amazon fire tv received my amazon fire tv weeks ago it works good very responsive with quad core but the interface seems very limited on apps the main ones are there amazon of course net fix and a must have alex but missing a lot of others still like roku as a main streaming unit a little slower but checked full of apps amazon needs to get with it if they are going to lead the pack here also the speech search is not usable with net fix or any of the other apps only works with amazon this is definitely loaded heavy on the amazon side it makes no sense to have a great feature that cant work with the whole package i would recommend to others but tell them of the draw backs so they know what they are getting in to here great product but needs some one to help it along\",\"disappointed update remote worked well for about minutes but now jumps around several spots when using the up down left right buttons i didn t really like using the phone app but will now have to go back to it update i was contacted by customer service and was advised to remove batteries and insert a fresh pair although batteries were brand new to begin with and to plug the firestick to restart it the remote has been working properly since doing this i also used the same batteries i just hope this isn t something that will need to be done frequently\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes normally you pay extra for features that are found in these boxes i have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting the advantage is that you can use your tv remote to access the content and that is about it htc these are desktop computers or mac minus or android sticks that you load software on to stream video to your tv these can add content that no normal streaming box can access without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn t mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time video game consoles xbox playstation can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams the downside is the cost unless you already have one and the interfaces these consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky you can use other options but frankly they aren t worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do now this amazon product has changed everything it might not be the box for you but honestly there is a good chance that it should be this is a brand new category for amazon and they got a lot right but there are a few shortcomings at least at launch as well so read all of this to see what those are amazon s fire tv boxers nothing else is this fast while roku impressed the world this raises the bar dramatically with a quad core processor and times the memory of any other streaming product it speeds through menus boots quicker starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times the best way i can explain it you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is that much faster voice search is amazing it really works less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time save and makes you wonder why this wasn t done before but it is only for amazon content and veto music videos at least for now you can not use the voice search with netflix for example ready for gaming well at least once you spend another the gaming controller feels a bit price for this type of gaming and really should be or less in my opinion that being said this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a very limited selection on roku but it is not a real console at and honestly shouldn t be compared to them better image quality i know you are thinking i am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally in different apps the video is slightly sharper and clearer we are using the exact same tv settings even the same hdi cable that we used with the roku until we switched it for the fire tv box we have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with roku now i don t know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something as image quality is a huge deal for most folks and normally us steamers have to suffer with decent quality this is certainly worth noting so far we have noticed this under netflix veto and alex cons it lacks soul yes soul the fire tv box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance cold fast efficient unlike roku where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of tico it feels warmer more inviting everything about this box is business like including the interface and the lack of options to change it the interface is more than merely cold it is simply less flashy pretty than the roku interface while fast i am less tempted to wander around like i do on roku it seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the roku interface i will update this more upon extended use the voice search only works for amazon s own content and veto and not most rd party channels like netflix the remote is not ready for gaming use compared to the roku remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements motion another feature about the remote i don t care for is the use of bluetooth instead of wifi roku used to use bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphones jack in the remote it will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned no headphones jack function like roku now to be honest if you use that on the roku it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature missing some popular channels at launch there is no hbo go no m go and no vfd in addition the channel count is much less than roku s at launch channels operate differently on first than the do on roku see my notes below for more information overall this fire tv box took so much from other company s products with only a few missing items they focused on delivering smooth fast performance with less fills than roku for the same price while there are missing channels and features the biggest failure for me personally is the cost of the gaming controller without it this box isn t ready for gaming but adding more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep had amazon included it with every fire tv box they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the roku a poor value if you do not have any streaming box yet i would highly recommend this box over every other product on the market right now i don t make this endorsement lightly i currently own roku boxes because i liked them so much until i used this fire tv box this box means roku will have to really work on improving their product for roku or they will lose the high end market an update my wife officially asked to replace the roku boxes with more fire tv boxes tonight yes these things are that good folks if you have a roku box really look at the missing channels and features are they something you could give up for faster performance also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps if the answer is yes then grab one of these and try it if no wait to see if amazon adds features channels at the very least consider an fire tv box for your next box i do not personally recommend apple tv as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements if you are on a budget and have an android based tablet consider chromecast it is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to roku fire tv i am giving this box a rating compared to a for roku i will update this review regularly for a while so check back for more information also if you have questions or comments please feel free to ask them in the comments section either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them update based on comments i wanted to add a few points regarding comments that i received the item free or are paid by amazon to write this review etc i paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box gray nothing was provided to me nor was i paid anything to write about this device i do not work for amazon i own my own company for this item i am just a customer in fact i didn t expect to even purchase a fire tv prior to it being announced because i figured it would only deal with amazon s own content which i feel is much weaker than netflix in fact i have talked two different family members into getting netflix over amazon s prime streaming service in the past month alone hbo go this has been repeated over and over in the comments but hbo go support for me is not something i am interested in as i do not have cable service anymore nor do i feel that hbo is a better value than netflix i would not go without netflix support at all but i personally think hbo go is more niche for many people and honestly i bet this device will get that channel before too long clearly the hbo go people seem to be pushing the issue but i know streaming box users and none use hbo go so while i noted the missing feature above people still seem to want to beat me up over it update channels it needs to be said that some channels require cable satellite subscriptions to those channels like hbo go not currently on this box showtime espn etc even if you have hbo it does not mean that your provider allows the hbo go so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind i do like the bloomberg tv not available on roku app which actually features a live tv feature netflix app is the older style with the tall covers like vhs boxes instead of the new netflix interface that uses short wide covers like on roku netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the fire tv box doesn t have it yet that makes comparing performance harder from roku to fire tv on my isp provider comcast netflix recently agreed to pay comcast so they have faster streams to customers i do not see a huge improvement in performance in burning like you see on other channels what it does seem to do is start in better quality and or speed the improvement in quality my guess is that the netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware one positive with the first app is that it plays the entire tv episode before switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode i can t tell you how many times i had to click click click and click just to see the end of an episode under roku also the first netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated roku app before going into a tv show first tells you how many total episodes that netflix has on the roku it shows you the number of seasons instead i personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference another point worth mentioning is that the first netflix app shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on that information is missing from the roku netflix app amazon prime content does not loop a feature they should add and likely will this means once you get to the end it just stops instead of keeping going voice search voice search does cover some rd party content despite everyone reporting it works on amazon s content only i have repeated confirmed it supports the veto app and will find music videos in that app that may mean that other rd party apps are covered as well or certainly might be able to be in the future if you search for something that has prime content and veto content it will default to the option with the most options to switch to the other simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or prime search results optical out i noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my lg tv via hdi and then use an optical out to my receiver so i never have to change the receiver s settings so i wasn t excited about this addition to the fire tv box over my roku boxes i stand corrected i decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this fire tv box something that i can not do with roku and it fixed all random lip sync issues i have from time to time on the roku box and the same with the hdi output on this box now i know this is not a typical setup for many people but i do know that tons of people have lip sync issues with hdi connections so being able to bypass the hdi minefield is much more important than i expected veto app this app works better than the roku app performance wise one quick example is that some content simply fails on the roku app try watching britney spears s work b ch don t make fun of me veto can play this video fine on youtube and on the fire tv app but struggles on roku s app some of veto s content is also available via voice search too remote i do miss the jump back button on the remote that roku features it is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn t hear because the phone rang or someone was talking you feel lost without it update they did include this feature but hid it bit you simply double click the reward button to skip back i haven t seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first people do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys this is the way it used to be on roku boxes before someone at roku decided to move it below the directional keys so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it multitasking what multitasking you ask since you haven t seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere i can understand your confusion but try this load a pandora stream then click on the home button and browse for movies tv you want to watch as long as you are in the home amazon prime content you can browse while pandora continues playing now pandora dies when you enter another app like netflix but it shows you that multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features again this tip is only found here another update this tip also works when browsing alex content before you play something so even when utilizing a rd party app it can keep going when it changes to a new song a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist alex app compared to the roku app alex for first is totally different there are some cool features like the backgrounds the screensaver using your photos and the much faster meeting night and day from roku but i do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to online to see i do miss that clicking the play button doesn t play a clip instead you select it click and then play it second click screensaver first has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion i am not saying you can t do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well this functionality covers rd party apps like netflix and alex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts this is the sort of thing you see on pcs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch game changing many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title i said nothing else is this fast to which one commented said nobody cares how fast an streaming box is that s not a game changeractually using it you will see what i mean this is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device like a fast computer which this basically is it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities when amd created their first processor that competed directly with intel s higher end processors it was a game changer correct because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever lowered pricing etc people will look back in years at this moment and say amazon s first changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made instead of barely enough processing power to stream they became able to compete with https and mac minus this is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes i said voice search is amazing and they said not unique by any means my xbox ps tablets all have this and all work amazingly find one person who owns this that doesn t say this voice search works better than anything from google apple or microsoft the fact that little old amazon could out deliver those tech giants is shocking the fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to there is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost i said ready for gaming well at least once you spend another to which they said and stick to basic android games no thanks i have a real console or a couple of them that can play real games this isn t meant to compete with more expensive game consoles it is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes just like tablets cellphone have brought gaming to millions they have not replaced gaming consoles and likely never will just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you can t play on that same console just imagine all the cheap under free games you can enjoy on your first box as i said above in my main review i think amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get polling playing the games but i can understand why they needed to limit their losses again this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device and the only one for a streaming video box every future streaming box will be measured against this one tell me how that isn t game changingplease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone i am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a recently balanced opinion of them hopefully this review has been helpful to you if so please let me know by clicking the button below remember you don t have to agree with everything i said to think it was helpful read more\",\"great for streaming we live in an rv and we get internet through our phones hotspot or from free wifi in rv parks fire tv is sometimes the only way to pick up the tv shows we have missed i have not been able to find cbn or the blaze tv on the device those and two of my favorites that i used to watch on the roku device that i miss\",\"disclaimer voice search instant play is it only works for amazon prime videos amazon fire is misleading i recommend staying with an apple tv the device is very fast and the instant play is one of a kind the voice search is unmatched by anything on the market the only problem with the voice search and instant play is it only works for amazon prime videos that is a disclaimer that should be noted somewhere at least in small print\",\"it s good but i like the device i had the apple tv the amazon is better than apple and roku the only network amazon needs is the wwe network app there is a lot of wwe fans out there with amazon that would love this app\",\"i love it i just received my fire tv box today and it is everything promised and then some imho i ve been exploring it and got started on cargo for the last hours and the menus are intuitive the voice search is quite nice and i love the way the remote feels in my hand a value buy in my opinion especially if you are an amazon instant video subscriber i haven t even explored all the other sources\",\"good start but needs work for starters there are only a few of the free prime shows listed there should be a section where all of the prime shows are placed and easy to find shows should only be listed once and then after clicking the show artwork the seasons available shows are all spread out so it is annoying having to go through them all show seasons aren t even together it is a mess that needs to be sorted yes there is voice search but if you don t know what prime videos are available you could spend days trying to find something to watch or just give up and go to netflix i bought this because it sounded like it would be better than my roku i am not yet convinced it is i know it is early in its release so i will give the developer a little time to fix the problems main problem is lack of prime videos and storage is limited so probably won t use it for games i am on my second day of owning this box an already it is telling me there is a problem loading videos the screen save pictures are nice though also we should be able to attach an external usb drive to download movies and music we buy i have several movies we bought from amazon but they only allow downloading them to windows pc so apple users are better served buying videos from itunes until this policy changes\",\"no way to just see prime stuff i really like the equipment it is small and works well the voice search feature is nice could have been a home run fire stars however not being able to down select to see just prime not so cool even the ipad app does that so one star for that go fix it update your software\",\"bought one from bestbuy and boy have i been impressed the voice recognition makes finding content so easy even worked with hulu i already had a logo pro so i tried out the games and for a android console they are first racecar better then you which i m sorry to say i ll never use again the tv and music content and menu s are very quick thanks to the very powerful hardware under the hoodoverall i m positive that this unit will kill roku and apple even google chromecast better be careful i own all these units so i speak from experience\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips and hbo go of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as

reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming

but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes read more\",\"small and yet soon big i am soon impressed with amazon fire tv believe it or not i sit and watch the screensaver lots a lot because the pictures are just that good it is like taking a trip around the world the amount of things you can do with this fire tv is pretty incredible to me there is so much on here and that can be added as apps is impressive there is a massive amount of things to watch both free with prime and much that is a fee to rent or buy i am glad i made this purchase this unit is so small i will take it with me on vacation and just plug it in to any tv with the hdi and keep up with my favorite shows\",\"i d love to see amazon take a netflix model for a i own a roku and apple tv and have to say that the amazon fire tv falls into more of the apple tv category it s definitely a walled garden of content that feeds you into amazon s prime tv offerings you can access a lot of titles there for pay and often less extensively than on demand options available from your cable provider however for your prime investment there are no free titles i d love to see amazon take a netflix model for a certain number of older titles the price barrier keeps me from watching older titles but the prices of latest releases are about average and worth it the interface is great i find the voice activation to be really accurate and easy to use it s really how you are meant to navigate the massive number of options available performance is best in class as the fire tv has a quad core processor that is unmatched by any other provider i d love to see a great game title arrive on the box that would make the game controller worth the investment however for an all in one solution the game selection can definitely hit the spot i use the alex and netflix apps available for this device and they perform great certainly there s no blu ray player that can match the capability of this device all in all i definitely recommend this device to anyone but still prefer the roku since roku isn t selling its own content service so it agnostically serves a lot of free content that you didn t even know existed\",\"no way to search or browse prime movies only fail i was really looking forward to using what was hoped as an amazing piece of entertainment equipment but the actual experience falls short pros user interface and underlying hardware is fast form factor of the device and remote control is very sleek plays games fairly well especially for such a small box quality of amazon videos is very good voice search works quite well the device came pre configured for my amazon account i just plugged it in updated the software and away i mentions first and foremost there is still no way to search for only free movies on prime amazon touts it s prime movies available but good luck finding them there is no categorization by genre you are stuck surfing through dumb lists of movies or using the search function which almost never returns any prime movies voice search works only on amazon content you can not use this to search within netflix for example the amazon first box only comes with gb of memory for game and app storage which is completely inadequate there are games available for download that consume almost gb for one game good luck downloading a gb game like the racing game featured in the list of top games clearly amazon is marketing this device as a way to push its video content in the help video that automatically plays the first time you use the device it even offers you a day prime membership for free to try it out however amazon has no incentive to help you actually search for and find this free content it s clearly evident in the lack of ability to filter search results on free prime content only this is my biggest beef with amazon by far i want a netflix like experience where my prime content is sorted by genre and i can search for free movies only now if you want to pay for video rentals by all means buy this device because it works really well if you want it to access your prime content only stick to the roku box you probably already have because it works just as good update i called customer service and talked to a guy about how i can search for and access my prime movies well you can t according to him i can only find the prime movies on the two lists on first that say recently added to prime and top prime movies those lists are items and items respectively there is no way to search or browse free prime content only the guy i talked to said this was a very common request for people of course it is i don t want to pay for video rentals if i just paid for a prime membership to access free content amazon completely failed i am returning the fire tv\",\"message to time warner cable cutting the cord and setting it on fire so when i moved into my house last year i made the obligatory call to two for internet and cable tv the bundled me into a dollar per month bill which includes ms internet in theory in reality i never see that telephone which i don t use because i have verizon home phone connect and tv with whole house dvr all the premium channels which i never watch ndtv etc after losing my job and having time warner get extremely nasty because i chose to spend what bucks i had left on food and gas rather than paying them and the fact that they have the worst service i had to swap out my box and waited in line for over an hour just to swap it out and then when the new box didn t work wait yet another hour in line to get a rd box i have decided no more two amazon fire tv is the corner stone of my plan to cut the cord i ve only had it for awhile tonight but i am so far blown away the voice recognition works flawless ok reviewers here raise your hand if your first search term was porn yeah i m immature regardless of what inappropriate word or attempts to baffled the system my teenage son and i threw at it it recognized everything with the exception of his latin ok amazon fire doesn t recognize latin but neither do i went to the youtube app because that is a part of my plan to ditch two could i play shows that were on youtube that i currently watch via cable check paired with my computer a mac i just searched for the video that i want hit play on the computer and it automatically is displayed on my tv i ve only had it boxed for hour so haven t tried netflix or hulu etc yet but one of the key activities i do a lot of is watching vod from amazon and it is voodoo much easier to do it using this device that via my bluray player picture quality even of standard def youtube videos is nearly as good as cable the next step of my plan to ditch two is getting fiber optic del installed once that has occurred i will be going from a dollar per month monopoly to bucks per month plus whatever i choose to spend on renting movies etc on demand and i never have to wait in line for hours to swap out hardware that i m renting from the cable company so for half the cost of months worth of time warner i m going to be able to preserve what little is left of my sanity which isn t much given that i tried testing this out with bad words like a kindergarten and the most fun i have had in awhile is listening to the cable customer service rep spend nearly an hour in trying to talk me out of not leaving him what if we gave you everything you have now for then would you stay me no if you could provide the same level of service for bucks less than you have been for the last year why didn t you just do it then rather than making me pay over bucks a month more than i needed to him what if i bumped up your internet bandwidth to the next tier for free me because i m not even getting the advertised speed as it is sorry two you are no longer a monopoly there is another game in town thank you amazon for giving me that ability to cut the cord s btw based on my little porn experience i will definitely be setting up the parental controls near\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours br br setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple br br the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell br br navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly br br the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote br br i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device br br perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content read more\",\"fire tv apple tv chromecast in addition to the fire tv i have an apple tv as well as a chromecast by far and large the best product is the fire tv i use it more than both the other ones combined having integration between my prime list and the device is clutch as i consume media across several different devices i do wish i could search by prime instant so i hope they will fix that i also wish i could cast a prime instant streaming video from a device to the fire tv but i don t see that as an option although i can cast youtube to my fire tv which is really cool there is no doubt that it is faster than both apple tv and chromecast and the voice recognition is so convenient i also have the game controller and the games are pretty good i don t game much but i wanted to check it out i was surprised at the speed of the games and the level of engagement i d also like to be able to see a future improvement where screens can be mirrored from devices to this both chromecast and apple tv have this from an educator s standpoint this could be the solution to wireless projection for classroom teachers apple tv doesn t play well with enterprise level security and chromecast doesn t do well with some software that is essential for instruction all in all it s my favorite media device it s faster has a great and happy ui and is easy to setup\",\"love our first voice search will totally spoil you this was so easy to set up we were up running in less than minutes and wow this is primarily my hobby s toy i play on the computer he flies the tv voice search is such a timesaver i used to have to stop whatever i was doing to type in whatever he needed to search for now he can handle it speak and ye shall find love love love this both speed of the video loading is awesome as is the intuitive search function amazon knows what he likes so his lists are more or less pre filtered so they load faster i baffled for weeks before buying this i read tons of reviews finally decided it would be worth the temporary honey how do i do this change in look feel etc we ve been streaming with a roku since about had the roku xd for a long time just before the change to first finally i decided to try it thinking if hobby had too much difficulty adapting we d just send it back while also trusting amazon to have made a massive leap forward have never myself been disappointed with any of their electronic offerings i was expecting to have to sync it with our router sign on to our accounts again and again amazon netflix etc note plug it in it turned itself on updated itself found my router was pre loaded with my amazon account we were from box to watching in under minutes there s even a or minute cartoon tutorial that teaches you everything you need to know to stream use your remote easy breeze when he wanted to try netflix he was able to easily click to install an app then i painfully used a grid keyboard to logo to netflix account username pid only once and we were done the voice search is such a leap forward it s incredible and accurate can voice search by title genre director actor everything and it even understands southern woohooit has times the processing speed and times the memory of our previous roku box wow what a difference in longtime resolution quality of picture vividness of color just awesome what can i say amazon did it again movie program descriptions are displayed at the bottom of the screen my only bubbling complaint is you can t change the font size on descriptions w o altering tv resolution which i won t do they do have excellent closed rationing functionality for those who need it you can enlarge the fonts there for easy readability basically i m very happy we took the plunge it really was a worthwhile improvement for us we prefer amazon s video streaming anyway they have lots more documentaries than the other streaming services i m just sorry i waited so long quick update not all apps come reloaded on the device though a ton of others did pandora bloomberg showtime anytime netflix veto vimeo watches tackle huluplus iheartradio and tuneinradio if you have an amazon kindly tablet i m guessing like the dx you can somehow toss photos from the tablet directly to the fire meaning sitting in your living room you can apparently swine the photo across the screen and it lands on the fire don t have that so can t do that however we do have many photos saved to amazon s cloud drive they were all accessible from the first console via the tv with just a click even a short family video we d uploaded with no interference from me just clicked on photos there they were easy a very nice feature\",\"amazon fire tv remote sucks i don t know what s wrong with fire tv remote but they tend to malfunction after a while i have no intention of buying another one when the replacement remote breaks again i m done with amazon fire tv and will look for another provider unless amazon gives me a free remote\",\"apps it will not store my netflix sign in so i need to sign in every time i do not like it\",\"i am not pleased every movie i select is a pay for i am not pleased every movie i select is a pay for view it s a good thing netflix on it every movie that is a pay for view can be found on netflix i don t need this device netflix is available on cable one\",\"pleased with the purchase i really enjoy the amazon fire tv i only have trouble locating all of the amazon prime movies and tv shows in one grouping i wish i could stream only the movies and tv shows that is included with my prime membership otherwise this device works excellent the install was a breeze glad i purchased it\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple the image quality movies and games is excellent i ve tried several movies from amazon prime and they look and sound nearly blu ray quality as far as i can tell navigation is very straightforward and it s generally easy to find anything you re looking for installation of games and apps goes very smoothly and generally pretty quickly the remote works very well i haven t played with the voice search feature much yet but when i have tried it it worked well the buttons on the remote are well thought out and i prefer it to the apple tv remote i only have one grape as far as i can tell there s no way to limit the list of movies and tv shows to what is available for amazon prime members this makes it very inconvenient to find things that are free to watch there are some categories that are limited to prime most popular on prime for kids on prime i want to be able to just see what s available for prime or at least be able to see by category what s available for prime i m sure this isn t an oversight i suspect amazon wants to force us to look at everything and be tempted to buy rent things but if they really want to compete with netflix they ll understand that we pay for our prime membership to be able to watch free movies conveniently a workaround is to do your searching on the web and then search specifically on the device perhaps i just haven t found the way to search for prime available content i hope that s the case or i will really be disappointed update the latest software upgrade as significantly improved the device for amazon prime members addressing most of my original complaints now that there is an entire section dedicated to prime content it is much easier to find things without having to wade through pay to view content i wouldn t mind seeing more categories to search through but don t want to diminish the improvement it s still not possible to search and return only prime content i think it should be possible to tell the device when you search that you only want returns from what is available for free to prime members the new music option looks intriguing but seems to have no purpose at this point not sure why it was added but i hope it grows into a useful feature given the new prime music package i would also like to see some sort of dna feature added as one who rips all content that i buy blu rays dvds cds to a computer on my network i would very much like to be able to stream this material to the first adding support for a connected usb device is not a solution for me i have no intention of keeping two copies of all this material read more\",\"a good initial release but fails on the promise as background i own several apple tvs roku s and chromecasts along with plenty of other devices i also have a large investment in bluray and dvd having had over films during my peak of building out a home theater with that comes a substantial uv vfd flixster and digital copy library itunes initial usage of the fire tv has shown me that this box is fast and flexible the voice search is excellent but for some reason the search only picks up amazon content it does not currently show available media on flixster or netflix this is for something that was touted as an open ecosystem and not a proprietary one well then how do i access my existing libraryworse but along with the previous point easily fixable is the fact that my only access to my uv library is through flixster flixster works great on a tablet but for some reason the fire tv is not properly caching the content of my movies so overtime i launch the app it takes minutes to show the content further all recent films are not available in hd this is a huge hole in the openness and functionality of the fire tv i can t search on my content i can t watch much of my content in hd easy fixes but a hard sale for someone who owns a roku or apple tv fire tv needs vfd as an app and access to the itunes library that folks own to be truly open i m vested in uv and amazon should take note of that as folks like me are typically the leading edge uv has matured and amazon needs to be a much better partner update i talked to amazon com and they confirmed that netflix chose to not enable the search functionality thus the fire tv search does not bring up netflix content the same appears true for flixster and they confirmed that fire tv is not currently a supported hd devices for flixster content all fixable but ultimately making the fire tv currently a closed eco systems with no real access to uv or other parties digital content that customers may already own it s a tough pill to call up a search for content you own and only be presented with purchase options from amazon\",\"decent replacement for something that shouldnt have had to be replaced it blows my mind theres not a class action lawsuit against amazon for their crappy fire tv remote after mine died like every other fire tv owner i refused to buy the same crappy expensive remote only to have it die again i found this cheaper option it works just fine with the newer fire tv it obviously doesnt have the alabama voice command but i never used that anyway\",\"awesome media box but i love this thing its what i have been looking for in entertainment its very fast and does gaming well but amazon slipped up when they only gave this gem gigs of storage space this is a game changer for sure but it needs at the very least gigs to fully enjoy fire tv would have loved to give fire tv stars but gigs is being cheap considering that most game titles are now legs each oh and one more thing it needs googles play store so us android users can use our paid games on this machine as well\",\"amazon prime on tv all is as advertised and am enjoying amazon prime on the large screen tv instead of my computer monitor installation and operation a snap\",\"unique place in the market perfect for the amazon ecosystem well after using it last night and sleeping on it the experience didn t actually sleep on my fire tv i had been debating between and stars i am a longtime media streamer i have roku and have bought more as gifts to family i also have a comcast and an xbox additionally i have tried various other streaming devices such as netgear not the d link movienite etc i am still trying to figure out why i bought the chromecast the least useful gadget i have ever owned first of all the fire tv is everything that amazon claims it is it is fast it is sleek the interface is handsome and of course very kindly fire like after looking it up it immediately downloaded updates an annoying process that almost every new computing device does whether it is a phone tablet streamer or computer it seems to take forever but it is really not that long it is just that we are in christmas morning opening presents mode and time slows down when you are excited about trying something new i give it stars because amazon delivered what it said it would i doubt it will replace anyone s existing favorite i would recommend it to anyone just entering the streaming media game and who has kids and amazon prime it is a fantastic portal to amazon products many people have tried to compare it to roku apple chromecast etc but to me i compare it to my xbox it plays video music and games so for some who want to have a less expensive alternative to an xbox one there it is of course you can not compare it xbox one or ps but not everyone wants to shell out dollars for a game or for a game console this is plenty for the casual gamer or kids being on the android platform will allow the number of apps to increase exponentially and for watching amazon s videos prime and pay it is perfect about the experience for amazon s offerings it is the best out there i highly recommend amazon prime as it is comparable to netflix plus i have saved a bundle on free shipping the interface for the movies is first class the remote s ff and rw buttons also act as skip forward and skip back buttons press rw once to jump back seconds or hold to rewind same for the ff button the interface for amazon video is similar to the new one for netflix on roku with the entire screens background feature the highlight movie surprising the interface for netflix on fire tv is the older one not the new one the alex app works fine for all my dna needs playing media from my home computers wish list allow us to change the position of apps when you start adding apps the latest one is the first one on the list so add them in reverse order to get your most frequently used ones at the top of the list there is a row of tiles for recently watched that allow you remove from that list but it is sludge those of you who have a kindly fire will recognize the system or add a quick access or favorites row of tiles at the top of the home screen would love to have amazon tie into the ultraviolet system i have close to movies there you can reach it through the flixster app but hd is not available on the flixster app logo vfd logo vfd logo vuduamazon get my pointing summary i will keep it and use it for amazon offerings it will sit beside my roku which i will use for everything else until the apps on my roku get ported to fire i do wish it had and infrared sensor so my harmony remote could use it but it is not a showstopper\",\"shouldn t have to settle for a phone app or paying of the entire thing to get another remote shame on you amazon my remote went out just a couple weeks after we received the fire stick put new batteries in it and it worked another couple weeks then i didn t have time to get to it until the return time was out i tried batteries again cleaning the ports and everything i could think of because i can t get the cheap remote working this fire stick is stuck on the television on which is was originally installed until i pay for a new remote amazon you can do better than this i see that there are many many posts of people like me whose remote just don t work a phone app is nice but shouldn t have to be the only answer besides another remote that costs of the original whole product\",\"gh performance is awesome but lacks critical features oddly this device deserves both a five star rating and a star rating at the same time the things they did right they did really really right and blow the competition out of the water but there are serious omissions that i believe an average television watched is going to surely miss for watching amazon content this device is glorious smooth extremely fast easy and convenient the performance is truly impressive and definitely best in class the voice search worked great for me although i am not pushing it to its limits with a medium range voice and no accent i love how it was already linked to my account since i purchased it from amazon classy touch major omissions annoyance the remote will not control your tv so for turning the tv on off and adjusting volume you will still need another remote other content providers netflix pandora etc are not integrated with voice search so your voice search will only call up amazon content and to access the others you have to enter into the app explicitly and use an on screen hunt and pick style interface to search i am hopeful that either the content providers will remedy this in the future or amazon will sell a bluetooth keyboard for the thing perhaps just make my google keyboard work also it does not come with an hdi cable most people probably already have a cable they can use but i can only imagine the frustration of someone purchasing this and not having the ability to plug it in this device in its current state will not really replace other devices you have it would most likely just be an added item for watching amazon content so a cable should have been included obviously this is a first impression review the fire tv was released yesterday some of my first annoyance could be remedied by a future software update but i don t recommend you buy this product just yet i am going to keep mine a few days to explore further and then probably send it back i will update this review\",\"good for what it is but not the ultimate solution i ordered this as soon as it was available and it arrived this morning for background i also have an apple tv which i hate but my kids love i also have various wdt models which i love the reason the kids love the apple tv is that the interface is so slick and quick which the wdt certainly lacks in this fire tv is even better imo than the apple tv and the wdt doesn t even come close unfortunately the fire tv misses in a huge way for me by not allowing the play of external content through the usb port from attached storage or memory stick if it had that capability and hopefully it will in the future this would be the perfect device this is why i am still hanging on to my wdt as my go to player it will play virtually any file format you throw at it which is a priority to me i have been reading about the alex app and that may satisfy my needs as well but i haven t dug deeper or tested it out if that is not the case for you than the fire tv would be a great option i am not familiar with roku because i could never justify the purchase due to the inability to play content from local storage unfortunately i jumped the gun with the fire tv because i saw that it did have a usb port and made the assumption it would support external content hopefully this will come in a future firmware release otherwise maybe alex will be able to fill that gap for me bottom line if external content is not important i would recommend this fire tv due to the availability of prime content and the fact the interface is beautiful and very quick the apple tv should only be a consideration over this if you are a fanatic apple loyalist or you have a tremendous amount of itunes content you want to be able to utilize\",\"fantastic right out of the box the fire tv came well packaged with extremely simple instructions plug in the power cable and hdi cable not included put batteries in the remote and that s it after initial start up there is an update that must be run but after a few minutes the unit was up and running interface is nice looking and easy to use voice search worked perfectly it understood this kentucky accent instantly flipping through the movie choices is super fast almost too fast since it has skipped a movie a time or two netflix is on the home page but you have to install the app before using it the first time as i m typing this review the unit is displaying some beautiful screensaver pictures while i have a movie paused if you store your photos on amazon s cloud you can use your own pictures instead picture quality is fantastic and movies start up lightning fast the only thing i see as a con would be how the prime movies are marked the placement of the prime marker in the upper left of the movie icon is very small and isn t as prominent as it should be making it rather difficult to tell whether it s prime or a movie you would rent purchase i figure in the days and weeks ahead amazon will be listening to customer suggestions as they usually do and more and more updates will be forthcoming making this device even better for me the amazon fire tv is a winner it will definitely be replacing a direct receiver i was using update after one full day of using amazon s fire tv i am more than satisfied with my purchase if you read reviews like i do make sure to skip over the ones that don t have the amazon verified purchase listed under their name or click that their post is unhelpful these are people who are trying to review a product without even having it in their possession if you discount those reviews which make the overall rating less than it should be you will discover that the majority of people who actually purchased this product are very satisfied update added the amazonbasics digital optical audio nolink cable and this has added a whole new dimension to the sound quality of my tv the sounds are more richer and louder than ever before i am continually amazed at what this little device is capable of i really suggest getting the cable i mentioned above to make your fire tv experience even better update turned on the device today and went to start up netflix all i got was a white screen turned the unit off and on but still a white screen i installed the netflix app and installed and it worked again i don t believe it was a problem on the device itself but rather the app since all of the other apps worked fine update had the same white screen issue with netflix some more contacted customer service and reported the issue he stepped me through the process of going into the settings then the apps when you come to netflix instead of installing click on force stop this fixed the issue if i have the problem again he asked that i contact them back immediately so that they can contact the developers with the issue i continue to enjoy this device and have since gotten rid of the direct receiver i had connected i can t recommend the fire tv enough update my fire tv is still going strong and i am completely happy with it i have found that i watch tv more so on the fire than my direct the one thing i haven t checked but will sometime is the usb port i ve got to save some movies to my flash drive and see if i can play a saved movie from the drive using the usb port on the fire finding amazon content is a breeze using the voice search and searching through movies or videos using netflix and others is fine yes it would be great to be able to use the voice search with everything else but it s not a deal breaker for me nor an inconvenience i would imagine amazon will eventually include their voice search on any third party application as time allows even after using it all this time i m still amazed at the sound and picture quality of such a tiny device for me amazon just gets better and better update i had movies saved to an external hard drive and i plugged it into the usb port on the amazon fire unfortunately it doesn t work it basically did nothing it made no noise like it was trying to access my hard drive nor did it recognize any usb plugged in hopefully amazon will push out an update to fix this at some point and time it would be a wonderful feature to have hint hint amazon\",\"works great with one critical flaw having received my fire tv today i ve been trying it out for the past couple of hours setup was a no brainer it required an update immediately so it did take about minutes to have it in action but the process was very simple

content at least for videos i believe that they do include a third party service if you search for music i am searching for house of cards season a netflix original i am a netflix subscriber so i would expect the netflix listing to be displayed but fire tv only returns the show s season available for purchase at amazon and does does not list netflix at all as a netflix subscriber i could watch both seasons and for free but according to fire tv s search season doesn t exist and i d have to pay per episode if i wanted to watch season see how roku s search second half of video correctly shows that season is available from netflix amazon go and vfd and that i can get get season from netflix it s also telling me checkmarks that i subscribe to of the services listed it s up to everyone to weigh amazon s faster and more convenient voice search feature that returns amazon only content vs roku s ability to find content across the channels services it carries review begins here as a current former owner and user of steamers such as roku roku stick and google s chromecast and also streaming gaming platforms such as ps ps and xbox one i believe i can do a fair assessment on what amazon s fire streamer is about and how it compares with the alternatives i rely on reviews to help me make informed and rational purchase decisions and hopefully my assessment of amazon s fire tv may help others decide whether this is what they need or want broad assessmentthe fire tv will have to find its place in a pretty crowded marketplace from what i ve experienced so far due to its tight integration with the fire dx tablets and amazon s own instant video service in search it should be a great pick for anyone who owns the amazon tablet and already subscribers to amazon s prime its ability to play games and the ease of downloading them should also appeal to non hard core gamers for everybody else depending on one s specific needs and expectations the fire tv may or may not be the right streamer to buy as one who purchased amazon s original kindly fire on day one and went through several generations of amazon s kindly reader i expect that amazon s streamer will also evolve or grow overtime amazon will listen to us and the next generation streamer will be a much more interesting new and improved more capable and better tuned to our needs and wants until then i would say that the current fire tv is a competent amazon content biased through search streamer with gaming capabilities lacking some in content and showing some innovation on search offset by its currently favoring amazon s service and the user interface in general parental controls and the games could make it a favorite streamer if young children are also watching if all you want is streaming and don t care about casual gaming you may feel that you are paying for capabilities that you don t need contentthe fire tv offers most but not all mainstream services and i suspect it covers what most of us will ever want to access and i am sure that more services will be added in time however at this time amazon s selection pages when compared to roku s wildly diverse channels but the roku have been around for a while all mainstream services now on fire tv are also available on roku ps xbox one and many on google s chromecast fire tv attempts to be a little different when it comes to accessing content allowing for voice search but results are currently returned mostly from amazon s instant video by comparison roku offer text based cross service search with results returned from most big providers amazon s attempt to predict and preload what we are most likely to watch will have to be assessed over a longer period of time so time will tell the soon to be implemented parental controls should differentiate and distinguish amazon s product from the competition once they are implemented innovationamazon s great innovative revolutionary disruptive device was the kindly reader and the enhanced kindly paperwhite i suspect that thousands of acres of trees are still known as forests instead of recyclable material these days because of the kindly amazon s fire tablets are nice but they are tablets the fire tv streamer gaming device falls probably under okay or interesting steamers and not too bad gaming platforms the quad core cpu is also nice but whether i m streaming on a significantly more powerful ps or a tiny one core cpu chromecast the video audio quality seems to be comparable and practically indistinguishable i assume that the reason for a more powerful cpu is the game playing part the lack of large permanent storage had implies that as a gaming platform the fire tv will allow for mostly small to medium size games with a lot of cloud interaction and storage again a feature that may not be suitable for those whose isis charge by the megabyte or impose a monthly download quota on their customers game playing on the fire tv works but those used with big console s lag free controllers that rumble talk back and sense motion may not view the fire tv as a serious gaming platform i would say that amazon s streamer is solidly in the mainstream as far as innovation it s a quality product but not a revolutionary one and that s still okay valuethere s very little that amazon s fire tv does that other platforms don t do the ps and the xbox one are vastly superior gaming platforms and equally good steamers and multimedia machines only they are much larger physically and cost significantly more the chromecast and the roku are a lot more innovative and allow for a lot more flexibility and integrate nicely with tablets and pcs and allow for streaming personal content without being limited to a specific brand or model of tablet they are also somewhat more difficult to setup small steamers such as the roku stick and the chromecast are very portable as they fit into one s shirt pocket amazon s fire tv could be carried around at least in theory but it s not as easy to move around roku is still the leader of content but amazon s selection should cover what most of us want to watch most of the time the fire tv costs a lot more than a roku or a chromecast but even if a gaming controller is added is still less than a ps or an xbox voice search as implemented on fire tv at the time i am writing this restricted to amazon and veto is in effect hiding content from other services potentially costing you money if one show is available to purchase or rent at amazon but it may be also carried by another service you subscribe to as a free stream who needs anyone who already has one or more roku chromecast or xbox playstation in their homes probably don t need one at this time unless they are tightly integrated into amazon s ecosystem or are cable cutters who wish some tighter controls over what their kids are watching those who are looking for their first streamer should consider fire tv s ease of use beats the chromecast but it s probably on par with roku and the xbox playstation amazon s great user support roku s enormous channels selection playstation and xbox being clearly superior gaming platforms if you don t mind paying up to for newly released games amazon s attempt to keep their users confined to amazon s own hardware platforms and content streams vs roku s and chromecast relative openness fire tv s split gaming streaming personality jack of trades vs roku s and chromecast focus on streaming price of course s not an easy decision to make i would be very happy with the fire tv if it was the first streamer device in the house with so many stream capable and game playing boxes sticks already operating and doing well i like amazon s fire tv for being a well designed capable streamer with some nice extra capabilities but i also like and i ve been using the roku for their huge number of channels and portability and great interface and the chromecast for allowing me to easily send whatever is in my chrome browser to the tv i hope that amazon s search will soon expand to cover non amazon services or it won t be a useful tool i may not have the the fire tv attached to the big tv in the living room but our daughter who happens to be a faithful kindly and amazon prime user asked for it in her room\",\"great remote hard to pair all in all i love this remote it s pretty small and find myself constantly digging for it in between the couch cushion my original remote is still functioning but will stop working from time to time i bought a replacement to be prepared for when it died i almost thought i received a doa replacement as it took me several tries to get this to pair up i followed the instructions verbatim several times with no luck even put in brand new batteries just in case the ones provided were dead nothing here is how i paired mine just in case anyone else is experiencing the same issue give these steps a try prior to filing a return if your original is still working remove the batteries so it will go offline make sure replacement remote has new batteries sometimes the ones provided are dead plug the power to your fire box stick this will make it restart plug the power back in to your fire box stick wait for the home screen to load hold down the home button on the replacement remote until it pairs up this now forces the device to pair to the replacement remote as it is the only remote online once it pairs select the new remote from the list done you will notice your old remote is still paired but offline now you can put the batteries back in the old remote and both remote will work simultaneouslyhope this helps anyone having issues with the pairing process cheers\",\"i like it amazon but this is important of people found this helpful was this review

this new amazon device a try this device works fine for the amazon instant video app but there is a terrible lag in the video on the netflix app that makes it unusable on this device i know this issue is not my internet connection as the netflix app works great on the roku devices in addition the user interface on this device is generally just not that great wish i could get a refund and get another roku box\",\"i love the fire tv it is just fantastic i love the fire tv it is just fantastic i am now now watching my ultraviolet collection with flixster app from fire tv and plays absolutely

great having bought of the roku and i am a little spoiled the fire has very few or limited outdated apps mostly amazon apps no hbo go no pbs no targetticket showtime anytime is out of date does not list direct as provider no vfd it does have flixster but it loads very slow the usb port is useless why is even there what a let down sending mine back not worth\",\"excellent streaming right out of the box i have used the fire tv for a day and i think that it is an enormous leap forward in set top box functionality my brief review follows but first i d like to comment on some of the negative reviews i ve seen for the product many of them are from people who haven t purchased the product others grape about what the product doesn t have even though they product clearly states that it doesn t have it for example there is a lot of grossing about no logo whether that comes to the first or not it isn t available right now a one star review because one app is missing or you can t stream some content from your hard drive even though there are apparently apps that will perform this task for the fire tv well take those types of reviews for what they might be worth let me start by saying that i own two roku s i ve owned roku s for quite some time i don t own the roku so my comparisons are probably stale the roku is a great product and you can t go wrong owning one but let me describe the features of the first that have so far delighted me easy connection to my wifi connection i have never been able to connect to my g network where my tv is located with my roku the fire tv picked up the signal easily and streaming is seamless it could be the dual antennas whatever the reason if signal capture is an issue for you the fire tv seems to work well loading of videos is very fast almost instantaneous i select a video press the remote to play and within seconds the video is streaming with no suffering issues it s very impressive set up was a breeze edit i have read that some people had an issue with the initial update that the fire tv requires mine updated with no problems i was able to connect to my wifi and my update downloaded and installed automatically voice search is very well done it took me a couple of attempts to learn to search after pressing the button and then hearing the been to talk once i figured that out i was searching for movies and tv shows easily the search results have been accurate this is a huge time save and a great convenience only amazon content is selected during the search process i understand that the other content providers have to permit search into their applications for it to work i have not figured out how to fling my fire dx screen to my tv yet once i figure this out it will open up all kinds of other options for the fire tv i didn t buy the product for this feature but i m interested to get it working this could be a huge game changer as you can access content at other sites on the web and display it on your tv i hope amazon provides more help to accomplish this i purchased the gaming controller and was able to pair it with the fire tv i haven t played anything yet but i m intrigued by the options one disappointment i have to mention where is amazon music my music collection should be available front and center there s an app for my phone there is an amazon music player app for roku so amazon should integrate the music collection it makes sense that they would do so in order to bring even more value to the entire amazon content platform i m thinking that there will be something shortly as the rumor is that amazon is going to provide a music streaming service in the very near future amazon needs to address this promptly overall if graded as just a simple streaming box it gets a with the other options the fire tv may provide miracast screen duplication games etc the product certainly exceeds my expectations updated i ve had the fire tv for two days now i was so pleased i purchased another and they have now replaced my roku xd s both of mine set up in no time and had no issues connecting quickly to my wifi network and installing the initial download i don t have a over technical set up for my wifi i have a comcast cable modem rd gen and a netgear router my fire s saw the router with ease and connected the g band this is something only one of my roku s could do because of the distance that one of them was from the router the video quality is superb i don t have these boxes set up to take advantage of dolly just simple tv speakers but the sound is forceful and clear i ve not had any issues of whining or other distortion that some have mentioned the voice search is frankly amazing i have read that some people don t like it or feel it is too limited but for searching your amazon options it is outstanding for me it is fast and accurate and is a huge time save i am eagerly awaiting adoption of the technology by other app vendors the screen layout does take some time getting used to i won t call it clunky but it is crowded it lists items in a fairly rigid order depending upon the category you are in and yes amazon content comes first that to be expected but amazon doesn t block your access to other apps if you want hulu or netflix you can get to them easily you can even use voice search to find the app you want i suspect there will be some streamlining of the interface at some point the interface does tie into the interfaces on fire dx somewhat so i can see the attempt at consistency here gaming so far has been limited but i ve found a great pinball app and am reviving my younger days on the tables the gaming controller works well and i don t have any lag playing the game i haven t attempted any others yet but i look forward to a good driving game i m a casual gamer not hard core and this system may just fit the bill my xbox glory days are over as my kids thoroughly thrash me at call of duty all in all this box delivers exactly what i wanted and more\",\"amazon fire tv amazon fire tv is a must to have especially if you are paying the high prices of cable tv on demand etc i have cancelled those options am enjoying most of those same features on amazon fire tv movies tv weekly shows music games view on tv screen all photos etc that have been saved on my amazon cloudlove it not going to pay the high prices of cable tv again easy hook up min total love you amazon happy happy customer o\",\"oem remote gave out after months considering replacement voice remote gave out nearly a year after i purchased changed batteries several times and nothing have to rely on phone app for it to function paid for the stick when it was being promoted to prime members now they want for an extra might as well buy another fire stick what a rip off for a hollow piece of plastic even with the voice remote feature i still don t think it is worth it amazon should sell the remote for dollars for prime members we shouldn t have to worry if it fails outside of the warranty period amazon is already charging an arm and a leg for prime membership and its content to begin with\",\"easy to use slick interface and very responsive very happy with purchase i ve been planning on getting a set top box for the past years but just never found something that had everything i was looking for briefly browsing amazon a couple of weeks ago i noticed they had their own recently release online media streaming device after looking over the specs and capabilities i thought it was about time to take the plunge especially since we ve been using amazon prime streaming services more and more now that our daughter watches kid shows i e dora umi zum blues clues etc though we ve only had it around a week we re very happy with the purchase we cut our cable over a year ago so plugging in the computer to the tv every time we wanted to watch something was beginning to get tiresome connection was straightforward and simple on boot it was automatically logged into our prime account not sure how it did this the interface is slick and really easy to find what you re looking for it s very quick not clunky when browsing through video options and for some reason i think it looks better could be mental i know another neat thing is that the remote doesn t have to have line of sight to the front of the box since it utilizes bluetooth it s all about the simple things anyways we re very happy with this little box\",\"a review from a non tech of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m your typical middle aged woman i don t game and i m not super tech savvy by any means so take this review for what it is the fire tv was easy to install and i m loving all the features free movies music and simple interface this thing even has a screen save that comes on when you re listening to music we ve always just had our comcast cable service without dvr and occasionally used comcast demand to watch rent movies but i ll never watch from comcast again the voice recognition software is amazing and brought me to exactly what i was looking for every single time i searched it s just so easy to find what you re looking for unlike comcast and since i m an amazon prime member most of what i want to view is free oh and for the new release movies the cost to rent from amazon is on average cheaper than comcast demand by a or more so happy with this purchase\",\"improvements there are many things i like about amazon fire tv but i get tired of having to reset it a lot of times i have to plug and plug it in after every use with netflix for some reason the screen turns white the second time i use the app would be great if you could fix this issue considering it took me an hour to get it initially started because of an update which makes no sense for a new product it has worked so so it freezes up when streaming videos on hulu a good bit i would like to have the option to remove shows from your watch list especially when i view a show for the first time and don t like it sometimes the shows will start and then go right back to the homepage this should not be happening without a button being depressed i guess everything new has bugs but my question would be when is amazon going to update the product and fix some of these bugs\",\"sent mine back out of the box mine updated and setup fine no problems biggest complaint is that voice search only searches amazon and a very few things from huluplus should search all content from at least the big netflix amazonprime huluplus had some picture glitches on huluplus netflix i switched over to my roku on the same content and worked just fine i didn t like the menus not as easy as roku netflix looks and works way better on roku i think this might become a player in the market that roku owns maybe but has too many problems for me to bet on that at full price i might buy one later when they go on sale and the software s been tweaked along with more channels added considering you can buy a roku for the same money or less with a huge list of public private channels also search that really works the fire tv is at this point a very bad choice don t pay them list price to be a fire tv beta tester\",\"amazing unit easy to set up just remember to amazing unit easy to set up just remember to also purchases an hdi to hdi cord that does not come with the amazon fire tv or you will have to wait to get started this makes my tv look more crisp and clear than it ever has easy to use absolutely love it\",\"a review from a non tech people found this helpful was

this review helpful to you yes no this integrated perfectly with our fire tv stick and was a great surprise for the gamers in the family it works great with the fire stick and does not negate the other remote giving us two remote options it even has a headphones jack making it so my husband can watch tv shows with bad language while the kids are in the room this is a great addition\",\"very capable set top box i got mine the day after it was unveiled out of the box it required an update it s the fastest ui of any other box that i have currently there aren t as many apps as i would like to see but i imagine they ll be coming soon i am not able to get my kindly fire dx to mirror the display yet it won t connect for some reason including more apps coming soon apparently the amazon music app will be available soon as well games are very cool i don t have the separate controller but have had fun with the games you can play with the remote these aren t mediocre games you would find on the roku but high quality mobile games of course the games aren t full on xbox or ps style but beautifully scaled mobile games you d play on your smartphone or tablet if you get your entertainment from the amazon ecosystem this is an excellent device\",\"a powerful new streaming box that challenges the competition a powerful new streaming box that challenges the competitionpros sleek thin good looking and powerful hardware fastest box available currently good video and sound output hdi optical audio out fast responsive ui and streaming good hardware firmware asap feature works well nice remote with novel voice search feature works very well gaming controller and internal gpu graphics processing unit games are fun on the fire tv graphics are surprisingly good decent array of apps at launch tons of content available quiet cool operation super easy set up and easy to use good support for local networked content via alex media server and apps potentially great gaming with some good titles available now asphalt peptide gp sev zero cons no sd card slot or other local storage expansion usb port not functional some reports say a usb keyboard will work have not tried it yet voice search only for amazon content currently some apps logo radio etc not yet available no hdi or audio cables included no easy way to search free prime video content only mixed in with pay to view could use a head phone jack and or std audio out as well as opticalwith a gh quad core cpu gb of ram a gpu and gb internal storage the fire tv represents a big leap forward in power for a streaming set top box add in dual band wifi ethernet and bluetooth support as well as a usb port not useful at present hdi and optical audio out and you have a sleek and capable hardware unit though missing a few nice things like an sd card slot amazon wants you to use the cloud or networked storage the power and memory at hand here promise a fast smooth user experience and the fire does seem to deliver that based on my initial use with these specs this is the fastest box out there currently this is also a box that is somewhat serious about gaming support as it has an internal onboard gpu and an available controller many game developers seem excited about the prospects and market this device represents currently you get a free game and amazon coins for each controller you purchase update i have tried several games and they are great fun graphics are surprisingly good controls smooth really pretty impressive for this type of system with p streaming and dolly digital plus surround sound the picture and sound is great it runs android basically kitkat so lots of apps should be available right out of the gate with lots more to follow some people are grossing about the price but i do not feel it is out of line at all and indeed it seems like a bargain compared to the competition s hardware capabilities to me you get a decent amount of performance hardware for your money so i think it s fine and i m sure there will be specials later for those who can wait i could not wait myself and ordered one immediately i like the roku i own several but this was too tempting to a geek like me clearly the fire tv aims to challenge the other contenders such as apply tv roku and chromecast each has their strengths and weaknesses but the fire tv seems like it will appeal to many you might not be too tempted if you already have a roku but if you are a resident of the amazon ecosystem you may find the fire a great asset those new to the game will find it worthy of consideration there are still a few rough edges as with any new product but none that seem too significant to me most will probably be addressed in short order but the main thing is that there s plenty out of the box that amazon got right and the fire delivers a great experience set up is very easy and straight forward the bluetooth remote is a nice touch for example and the voice search is promising while it currently seems limited to amazon content hopefully this will expand at some point even so it s fun to use streaming seems to be smooth and glitch free in my tests so far mostly with amazon prime instant and netflix i will do more testing and update this review as i learn more load times are generally very fast sometimes almost instantaneous and the fire tv is quite responsive video quality is very good the menu is decent enough similar to roku and others it is a bit amazon centric as you might expect hopefully future updates will allow one to customize it a bit more but simple and sweet is what most people want and that s what you get here your amazon video library and watch lists are available of course a lot of my favorites like prime instant netflix pandora iheartradio and so on are here radio is missing and i hope it gets added soon i m sure all the main ones will get on board it s just too big a market to ignore i have not had time to set up alex yet but that promises to be a great feature for sharing photos music and videos from other devices including a pc laptop or tablet i have alex in the past and it generally worked very well i will be very interested to see how it goes with the fire tv and will update here amazon seems to have taken particular care to address the suffering issues sometimes experienced with devices of this type and i have not seen any such issues so far at all dicembre to come as i have more time and experience with this device giving it a solid stars for now pending further time with it i really like the fire tv and likely will upgrade to stars if no glitches turn up upgraded to stars everything working well gaming is a lot of fun gfx better than expected everything loads faster than any other system i have used sony netgear roku etc everything looks great i feel like the value is there especially if you are already in the amazon ecosystem but non amazon stuff like the netflix app also work well i hooked my amazon fire tv up my season projector and game big and it was a blast prime instant kids and netflix looked great as well the fast responsive interface and overall happy performance make for a great experience gaming i got peptide gp for the amazon fire tv still waiting for my game controller so played using only the fire tv remote but even so it was a lot of fun especially big screen using my projector reminds me of playstation games a good thing the graphics are darn good better than i expected and the game is a lot of fun and fairly easy to pickup and play the game controls work well even using just the remote this is the first game i ve tried on the fire tv and i was very surprised and pleased with the quality definitely worth a try if you like racing games update got my controller works well asphalt peptide gp and sev zero all look great and play great very impressive i think the fire tv is going to surprise a lot of people in the area of gaming tip in parental controls you can set up a pin or use your existing one and enable pin protected purchasing so that a pin is required for any purchase made via the fire tv although meant primarily to prevent kids from purchasing without a parent s approval it s can also serve to prevent accidental one click purchases of your own note if you re interested in more details you can find pdf s of the user guide quick start controller manuals and so on here www amazon com gp help customer display htmlnodeid\",\"my voice remote controller posed out purchased my first one with the tv fire box over a year ago and now it is gone purchased a second one but you would think amazon would do a better in taking care of some people having the same problem with them my daughter can control the box from her iphone as another person listed so we may send the order back for refund after it gets here tomorrow i do have two fire sticks as well in the bedrooms and no problems with those\",\"finally the right streaming device this is a wonderful streaming device i have been an apple tv man since but i have decided that i just might never return to my apple tv i have used owned all generations and have known them inside and out unlocked my st generation for secret stuff shah and swore by them for years i just received my amazon fire tv device this afternoon and plugged it up without a hitch voice command is a nice touch but i was most impressed with the speed of the quad core processor no more waiting for my videos to buffer and this is especially important in my house where my wife kids and i are sometimes simultaneously streaming videos final word if you re just looking for a great device to stream both netflix and amazon prime then you ve found the right streamer\",\"update no longer works with fire tv update no longer will pair with nd generation first since reset update it did still pair with st generation first i have in another room was working fine with my nd gen until i reset it after having external memory problems original review works and pairs quick with fire tv just no voice search my wife likes her own amazon remote so this works good for us at half the price of the fire tv remote sold here my only concern is how small it is but hopefully that won t be a problem\",\"nd bad remote second remote stopped working will not work with firestick software on tv very carefully chose home arrows has a mind of it s own had to plug so that it wouldn t register device i did not choose that selection bad device kept defaulting to video game or going to sleep options window however none would select going to look for another service\",\"nice some content was found but unavailable as an owner of various models of roku and apple tvs i didn t really need yet another streaming device but i decided to give it a try it works great i do like the voice search feature we tried watching some of our favorites like midsommer murders all of the seasons and episodes showed up which was nice but only a few of the earlier seasons were watchable for free and a few of the more recent were available for but most were unavailable that happened to several other bbc series that we tried to watch however the movies we have watched streamed without a hitch with good picture and sound\",\"amazon fire tv a must have this was easy to set up i can access many movies and purchase new releases without going out of the house to search for a video store i can also access my netflix i love this and wondered how i ever lived without it thank you amazon\",\"some hulu plus shows are not available many shows that are available on hulu plus website are not available on amazon fire tv hulu plus app a message says that this show can only be viewed at hulu com very disappointing example days of our lives\",\"it s ok technically the best compared to others on the market my complaint is that the selection of movie apps such as vfd which i have a very large library and the lack of cable apps such as hbo go\",\"great device this thing is amazing i wish there was someplace you could go to see all the titles available on prime everything i ve seen shows a few here and a few there but this device is terrific highly recommended\",\"this box is a game changer for on demand content amazon knocked it out of the park refreshed updated with tips i am not a casual user of on demand content and devices having tried smart tv s from brands smart dvd bluray players apple tv wdt htc chromecast and too many other competing products to mention for streaming content before this box you really had two options for a simple to use box that doesn t require additional items or tweaking first is apple tv which is easy to use interface but apple limits the content you can get greatly including no prime streaming built in and it lacks a lot in features as well and is slow the reason for selecting apple tv is if you have other apple products that unlock features like amazon s content the second option you could consider was roku which really means a roku box since it is heads and tails better than past roku boxes in terms of remote and speed now roku stands out with the most content and the most features of any box with the roku it is for that reason you will see me address the roku so often in this review i have added quick summaries of other options to make sure everyone knows about the other options out there wdt are great for streaming your own content but not very user friendly chromecast is very cheap at but requires other items to use no remote included is limited to channels according to their own site with other content broadcast via chrome s browser not at the same quality level this does allow you to browse the internet on your tv and is amazing for the cost but is more of a niche market than first roku apple tv but if you can live with the short coming it is worth a look at the price of these devices smart tvs most of these are fine for occasional use but not nearly as pleasant to use daily like separate boxes normally you pay extra for features that are found in these boxes i have not found a smart tv that is decent and is also a good value for what you are getting the advantage is that you can use your tv remote to access the content and that is about it htc these are desktop computers or mac minus or android sticks that you load software on to stream video to your tv these can add content that no normal streaming box can access without giving up quality but they are only recommended for something comfortable with technology that doesn t mind fixing the issues that come up from time to time video game consoles xbox playstation can access some of the content that streaming boxes do and have plenty of power to deliver the streams the downside is the cost unless you already have one and the interfaces these consoles are not designed to stream video exclusively so the interfaces are decent but can be clunky you can use other options but frankly they aren t worth the hassle for the amount of hair pulling you would do now this amazon product has changed everything it might not be the box for you but honestly there is a good chance that it should be this is a brand new category for amazon and they got a lot right but there are a few shortcomings at least at launch as well so read all of this to see what those are amazon s fire tv boxers nothing else is this fast while roku impressed the world this raises the bar dramatically with a quad core processor and times the memory of any other streaming product it speeds through menus boots quicker starts videos quicker and honestly has the muscle to not struggle with higher end resolutions and surround sound like other boxes can do at times the best way i can explain it you will have extra hours at the end of the year because this box is that much faster voice search is amazing it really works less using a four directional keypad to enter in titles is a real time save and makes you wonder why this wasn t done before but it is only for amazon content and veto music videos at least for now you can not use the voice search with netflix for example ready for gaming well at least once you spend another the gaming controller feels a bit price for this type of gaming and really should be or less in my opinion that being said this box has real games you would actually want to play instead of a very limited selection on roku but it is not a real console at and honestly shouldn t be compared to them better image quality i know you are thinking i am imagining things or have changed my setup but both myself and my wife have noticed that generally in different apps the video is slightly sharper and clearer we are using the exact same tv settings even the same hdi cable that we used with the roku until we switched it for the fire tv box we have noticed that especially on poor quality feeds that the image quality is noticeably better than under the same feeds with roku now i don t know if there is better graphic chips or if the bigger processor can do more tweaking while streaming but it seems to be something as image quality is a huge deal for most folks and normally us steamers have to suffer with decent quality this is certainly worth noting so far we have noticed this under netflix veto and alex cons it lacks soul yes soul the fire tv box and remote are built like a dvd player or appliance cold fast efficient unlike roku where the box seems to have a bit of the personally of tico it feels warmer more inviting everything about this box is business like including the interface and the lack of options to change it the interface is more than merely cold it is simply less flashy pretty than the roku interface while fast i am less tempted to wander around like i do on roku it seems like they are being pretty dependent on the voice search function which is great but it leaves you missing out on the random items you find along the way with the roku interface i will update this more upon extended use the voice search only works for amazon s own content and veto and not most rd party channels like netflix the remote is not ready for gaming use compared to the roku remote with gaming buttons when you turn the remote sideways and more sensors for detecting movements motion another feature about the remote i don t care for is the use of bluetooth instead of wifi roku used to use bluetooth on their former high end box but instead replaced it with wifi to increase battery life and to add the headphones jack in the remote it will likely take a few weeks of use to report battery life but this has me concerned no headphones jack function like roku now to be honest if you use that on the roku it can be a battery drain but it is a cool feature missing some popular channels at launch there is no hbo go no m go and no vfd in addition the channel count is much less than roku s at launch channels operate differently on first than the do on roku see my notes below for more information overall this fire tv box took so much from other company s products with only a few missing items they focused on delivering smooth fast performance with less fills than roku for the same price while there are missing channels and features the biggest failure for me personally is the cost of the gaming controller without it this box isn t ready for gaming but adding more for the ability to try out the functionality seems pretty steep had amazon included it with every fire tv box they would have sold a lot more games and had everyone calling the roku a poor value if you do not have any streaming box yet i would highly recommend this box over every other product on the market right now i don t make this endorsement lightly i currently own roku boxes because i liked them so much until i used this fire tv box this box means roku will have to really work on improving their product for roku or they will lose the high end market an update my wife officially asked to replace the roku boxes with more fire tv boxes tonight yes these things are that good folks if you have a roku box really look at the missing channels and features are they something you could give up for faster performance also look at my notes on the features of the various common apps if the answer is yes then grab one of these and try it if no wait to see if amazon adds features channels at the very least consider an fire tv box for your next box i do not personally recommend apple tv as they are still too slow and lack too many features and functions apple keeps promising something amazing but delivering minor improvements if you are on a budget and have an android based tablet consider chromecast it is a good value for the price but you do give up features and content to save on the cost compared to roku fire tv i am giving this box a rating compared to a for roku i will update this review regularly for a while so check back for more information also if you have questions or comments please feel free to ask them in the comments section either myself or other helpful people will do our best to respond to them update based on comments i wanted to add a few points regarding comments that i received the item free or are paid by amazon to write this review etc i paid the full list price and local sales tax for this box gray nothing was provided to me nor was i paid anything to write about this device i do not work for amazon i own my own company for this item i am just a customer in fact i didn t expect to even purchase a fire tv prior to it being announced because i figured it would only deal with amazon s own content which i feel is much weaker than netflix in fact i have talked two different family members into getting netflix over amazon s prime streaming service in the past month alone hbo go this has been repeated over and over in the comments but hbo go support for me is not something i am interested in as i do not have cable service anymore nor do i feel that hbo is a better value than netflix i would not go without netflix support at all but i personally think hbo go is more niche for many people and honestly i bet this device will get that channel before too long clearly the hbo go people seem to be pushing the issue but i know streaming box users and none use hbo go so while i noted the missing feature above people still seem to want to beat me up over it update channels it needs to be said that some channels require cable satellite subscriptions to those channels like hbo go not currently on this box showtime espn etc even if you have hbo it does not mean that your provider allows the hbo go so look into that before purchasing any box with that in mind i do like the bloomberg tv not available on roku app which actually features a live tv feature netflix app is the older style with the tall covers like vhs boxes instead of the new netflix interface that uses short wide covers like on roku netflix has said they are moving everything to the new software but the fire tv box doesn t have it yet that makes comparing performance harder from roku to fire tv on my isp provider comcast netflix recently agreed to pay comcast so they have faster streams to customers i do not see a huge improvement in performance in burning like you see on other channels what it does seem to do is start in better quality and or speed the improvement in quality my guess is that the netflix app needs to be tweaked to maximize the performance of this hardware one positive with the first app is that it plays the entire tv episode before switching to a small window with the countdown starting for the next episode i can t tell you how many times i had to click click click and click just to see the end of an episode under roku also the first netflix app has two features that were removed from the updated roku app before going into a tv show first tells you how many total episodes that netflix has on the roku it shows you the number of seasons instead i personally prefer the number of episodes but clearly that is a personal preference another point worth mentioning is that the first netflix app shows you how many items you have in your list and what item number you are on that information is missing from the roku netflix app amazon prime content does not loop a feature they should add and likely will this means once you get to the end it just stops instead of keeping going voice search voice search does cover some rd party content despite everyone reporting it works on amazon s content only i have repeated confirmed it supports the veto app and will find music videos in that app that may mean that other rd party apps are covered as well or certainly might be able to be in the future if you search for something that has prime content and veto content it will default to the option with the most options to switch to the other simply arrow up and either left or right to see the music videos or prime search results optical out i noticed this box featured an optical out port but normally run everything through my lg tv via hdi and then use an optical out to my receiver so i never have to change the receiver s settings so i wasn t excited about this addition to the fire tv box over my roku boxes i stand corrected i decided to run my audio via the optical cable into the receiver directly from this fire tv box something that i can not do with roku and it fixed all random lip sync issues i have from time to time on the roku box and the same with the hdi output on this box now i know this is not a typical setup for many people but i do know that tons of people have lip sync issues with hdi connections so being able to bypass the hdi minefield is much more important than i expected veto app this app works better than the roku app performance wise one quick example is that some content simply fails on the roku app try watching britney spears s work b ch don t make fun of me veto can play this video fine on youtube and on the fire tv app but struggles on roku s app some of veto s content is also available via voice search too remote i do miss the jump back button on the remote that roku features it is a tiny thing but it once you are used to jumping back to see that painting in the background or catch that line that you didn t hear because the phone rang or someone was talking you feel lost without it update they did include this feature but hid it bit you simply double click the reward button to skip back i haven t seen anyone else mention this tip so you saw it here first people do like that the enter button is back in the center of the directional keys this is the way it used to be on roku boxes before someone at roku decided to move it below the directional keys so you have to move your thumb oddly to press it multitasking what multitasking you ask since you haven t seen this advertised or mentioned elsewhere i can understand your confusion but try this load a pandora stream then click on the home button and browse for movies tv you want to watch as long as you are in the home amazon prime content you can browse while pandora continues playing now pandora dies when you enter another app like netflix but it shows you that multitasking is built into the operating system and may be utilized in future features again this tip is only found here another update this tip also works when browsing alex content before you play something so even when utilizing a rd party app it can keep going when it changes to a new song a small window pops up on the lower right hand side of the screen to tell you know the new song title and artist alex app compared to the roku app alex for first is totally different there are some cool features like the backgrounds the screensaver using your photos and the much faster meeting night and day from roku but i do miss the channels not requiring a couple clicks to switch to online to see i do miss that clicking the play button doesn t play a clip instead you select it click and then play it second click screensaver first has a screensaver that is honestly pretty cool in my opinion i am not saying you can t do this with other boxes but no other box comes set up to display random photos and includes a decent amount of beautiful photos as well this functionality covers rd party apps like netflix and alex too so you have a seamless slideshow no matter what you are using when it starts this is the sort of thing you see on pcs not streaming boxes and it is a nice touch game changing many commenters have argued that this device is not gaming changing and many have rating my review not helpful because of that title i said nothing else is this fast to which one commented said nobody cares how fast an streaming box is that s not a game changeractually using it you will see what i mean this is the first time a company has put so much into creating a very solidly made hardware device like a fast computer which this basically is it will depend on software that is written for it to fully show off its abilities when amd created their first processor that competed directly with intel s higher end processors it was a game changer correct because it changed the landscape of personal computers forever lowered pricing etc people will look back in years at this moment and say amazon s first changed how consumer streaming video boxes were made instead of barely enough processing power to stream they became able to compete with https and mac minus this is the beginning of a new generation of streaming boxes i said voice search is amazing and they said not unique by any means my xbox ps tablets all have this and all work amazingly find one person who owns this that doesn t say this voice search works better than anything from google apple or microsoft the fact that little old amazon could out deliver those tech giants is shocking the fact this works via a tiny remote makes it very easy to get use to there is no other product in this price range that does this and no other streaming box even offers it at any cost i said ready for gaming well at least once you spend another to which they said and stick to basic android games no thanks i have a real console or a couple of them that can play real games this isn t meant to compete with more expensive game consoles it is meant to bring gaming to streaming boxes just like tablets cellphone have brought gaming to millions they have not replaced gaming consoles and likely never will just like this box will not have you ditch your gaming console either but instead it opens you up to tons of games you can t play on that same console just imagine all the cheap under free games you can enjoy on your first box as i said above in my main review i think amazon really should have thrown in the controller to really get polling playing the games but i can understand why they needed to limit their losses again this is a best in class hardware device with real gaming and the best voice search on any tech device and the only one for a streaming video box every future streaming box will be measured against this one tell me how that isn t game changingplease understand that everyone has different priorities and requirements so no one box is going to be perfect for everyone i am attempting to do my best to address most of the many options and provide a recently balanced opinion of them hopefully this review has been helpful to you if so please let me know by clicking the button below remember you don t have to agree with everything i said to think it was helpful\",\"great way to watch movies this little piece of equipment is a great way to watch movies and tv series it s so simple to use\",\"better than apple tv roku i have had apple tv and roku for over a year and i can say without reservation that the amazon fire tv is far better for two reasons the program movie i want to watch starts immediately with a single click unlike roku and apple tv which can take forever at times after several clicks voice search having to type search can be cumbersome and a nuisance unless i want to watch one of the itunes movies i own on the apple tv i always use the fire it s simply better\",\"from a roku owner and now fire tv this review is to try to offset some of roku employees that are on here trying to knock this device the first thing you notice after plugging everything in is a minute demo that you can unfortunately not bypass even if you know your way around these types of devices you will only see it once and then you re good to go the device is small and beautiful the remote is better than any other device including roku and my wd tv live first the pros it s the fastest media streamer by far that s not only a good thing if you own one but it will force roku and other companies to stop skipping on the hardware and firmware updating the menu is intuitive and easy to maneuver you can t move things around yet but i m sure they will eventually let you customize your own page as of now the apps which would be at the top if i could change it are at the bottom apps are larger and higher resolution than the roku the voice button is amazing for a first attempt they almost got it right i understand this is a proprietary device so they will always want you to use amazon instant video for your viewing but this option should search for all of your linked accounts including hulu netflix etc i m not sure that they will ever fix this because they will lose money and viewers even so it s still a pro because it does work well streaming quality wow everything i ve tried buffers so quickly that it s almost already at p when it starts playing with my roku netflix looks great but it takes seconds to get there i currently have maps of internet so i m not sure what everyone else goes through but i can tell you this streams better than roku period overheating and reboot my roku can not handle more than a couple of hours of viewing before it decides that was too many rows of stairs it gets exhausted and it has to reset itself this device is more powerful and after using it all day today i can say my roku will be immediately up for sale once they add the time warner cable and logo apps alex okay i always blamed my alex for the long delays on my roku with my internet speeds i could never understand why it was always loading at p settings regardless of the nitrate anyway i was wrong it s the device not only does the fire tv have a much better alex app which is beautiful btw but everything streams at maximum quality within seconds no re loading suffering during movie playback and the movies are in a much nicer grid layout so i don t have to sift through one row to get to a movie selection now the cons obviously it s still missing some apps you are crazy if you think logo will go much longer without being added the same for other apps they built it so they will come interface it is nice but as i stated in the pros you can t make changes to it hopefully just for now if it stays this way it will be a little annoying to have to scroll down all the way just to get to my apps one major issue that is very upsetting to me is the fact that they couldn t add two very important things usb and ac if amazon claims they were listening they would also know that these two things would dramatically improve the user experience i haven t plugged my wd tb hard to it yet but it is a hard drive now it will unfortunately revert to speeds don t build a supposedly forward thinking device with two things that are now considered dated i have a feeling this was done to make money off the fire tv thanks for that overall it is the best device currently available and they really made the experience fun it does make you want to call your cable company and cancel service buy it you will not regret it\",\"it s actually great minus one thing i really like the fire tv box so far the voice search thing is pretty good but i just wish it had the ability to surf the internet\",\"i like it amazon but this is important amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysjuly hi dallas thank you for sharing your feedback we wanted to let you know that we made it easier to find your favorite prime content with the click of your remote you can now browse many more prime only categories including top prime tv top prime movies prime tv for kids prime movies for kids prime tv by genre and prime movies by genre\",\"disconnect from wifi but the features are great i love the features of the amazon fire tv the price is right the interface is great but it after less than minutes keeps disconnecting from my wifi and giving a network error message mind you my router is about feet from it needless to say because of this i cant watch amazon prime tv shows or movies on it i have an apple tv in my sons room way down the hall also connected to wifi the apple tv never disconnect from wifi i would love to be able to use the unit not sure why this is happening but i may have to return it shame\",\"replacing an even worse remote waste of time remote did not activate nor did it connect to box a poorly designed remote replacing an even worse remote waste of time ordered two items had to pay shipping on both they were both shipped in the same padded envelope why double shipping charges\",\"its ok i like the voice search and speed of this unit the things i don t like is that i have to keep installing apps to be able to keep on using this thing the fire tv does not even come close to the app selection for watching tv compared to the roku so if you are looking at a tv watching device buy a roku\",\"battery draining remote i have had to change the batteries in this remote once or twice per month since i purchased it in march after the battery s short life span after the first battery replacement we stopped doing any gaming with it and just used the gaming controller it did not make a difference it still drained the batteries just as quickly i do have the option of using the phone app and i do but what if i m not home and someone else wants to use the fire tv this is very very poor quality product of course it went out of warranty days ago i guess i should have been more mindful of that date i do not recommend this product and i think amazon should extend the warranty coverage it is ridiculous that this remote basically doesn t work\",\"nifty little device this is a great device if you don t have a smart tv apparently mine streams amazon prime but the interface is so terrible that i never bothered using it or other streaming device besides the chromecast which is very limited first of all little things the packaging was very nice the remote itself feels amazing to hold and the buttons are very simple the fire tv itself is beautiful very minimalist all you see is the tiny led on the front when it s in use the voice search is great it didn t catch ilina mental but it could be because i searched her name right after searching john travolta it brought up musicals will ferret etc without a problem voice search only works within everything available on prime it seems things available to rent or stream and i wish it included the netflix titles perhaps with a see on netflix button instead of just showing me the rent option for what isn t on instant prime i wish you could sort by amazon prime only movies with an interface similar to netflix s i want to see what s available to me now not what i can rent the games are fun and it s pretty cool to be able to play phone games on the tv my whole family actually enjoyed playing minions rush i don t have any controllers yet and i hope that p games if they aren t out yet are coming in the future i ve only had mine a day but so far i m loving this purchase we do have an xbox one smart tv and even a computer hooked up downstairs into the same monitor but the bone interface for netflix is so awful that we hardly ever use it unlike the one on the and it s a pain just to have to start up the computer and interact with such a huge screen with computer peripherals because our video smart is rather clunky and slow it has never loaded any video streaming for us before somehow crashing this fire tv clears those problems and with an incredibly simple interface love it i would give this stars if you could use the voice search for commands and inside apps such as netflix edit april after using my fire tv for about a week i ve settled into what i use it for most until i get my gaming controller which is apparently on rankorder until the rd i mostly wanted a device to watch my favorite shows via netflix or locally without any troubles it s much faster to launch and use the netflix app on the fire tv than it is on my smart tv the xbox one and the computer hooked up to it via hdi it s also perfect for streaming locally via alex my music tv shows movies and more are so very easily accessible on here vs the computer hooked up which is not my pc and the xbox one which is such a nightmare for this task that i barely consider it this app is only cents and will make your fire tv experience a lot more enjoyable so you really owe it to yourself to get it i absolutely love the feel of the remote and how simple and intuitive it is to use after finding with the tv remote for the input button which despite always being in the same spot i always have trouble finding it s a joy to use a remote that is much simpler this probably makes me sound old i m the remote orientation doesn t matter so you don t fiddle around with making sure you ve pointed it correctly i suppose this is because it uses bt the voice search which i use somewhat often is a joy to use it s much better than shouting across the room at the direct which only picks up what i say less than half of the time i hope microsoft doesn t save voice recordings the same way amazon does because about of that is just me yelling profanities at the direct\",\"wow buy this immediately i received my fire tv today i am surprised amazed thrilled and extremely pleased it s all that and a bag of chips the ease of use is so simple lookup is a breeze i had it hooked up and running with in minutes the remote is small so what my only con is the voice search should be for everything to own this and not have amazon prime should be a crime lol it s a must for the fire tv i gave up direct tv in january i was paying to much for what i was getting with the fire tv it s customized tv at your finger tips no more paying for channels you don t need and no more cable bill i hope more people are waking up and pitching pay tv i pay for netflix i watch tackle for free no more commercials no more unwanted un needed channels movies when i want sit coms when i want no more running to pick up a dvd i m telling ya streaming is where it s at and this device is a must life is hard this is easy\",\"omg ok i m not going to lie this thing as the fastest setup i thought i was seeing things when i turned it on for the first time apparently this device is connected to your amazon prime account so once you turn it on it automatically literally goes straight to your prime account without signing in i seriously had to call customer service because i was really created out on if i signed in or not anyway this thing is way better than the roku though i do wish they had a iphone app for it because the remote is so small and i tend to lose it alot its pretty much the same format on the roku when it comes to netflix and hulu it goes to the next episode atomically like samsung smart tv and the roku but i guess its a common thing but amazon prime you have to select the next episode itself i seem to see this in a lot of other streaming devices\",\"superior amazon customer service support was the deciding factor for me here goes i m the thousands reviewer for this product lol short preface i love amazon so when comparing all streaming devices in the end i went with the fire tv because of the outstanding customer service and it will improve with time that being said i share the frustrations that all my fellow buyers have i hate not being able to sort out the non prime videos i truly dislike paying for an episode i didn t see that one coming even though i did a ton of research but overall i love my new cable bill which only includes internet and basic and i mean basic service because i m preserving the right to order hbo and showtime at some point was massively disappointed in hulu plus because they don t offer the entire series in a show anymore did they run out of server space or what netflix was a pleasant surprise in case you are wondering netflix hulu plus and prime are your alternatives to paying your cable bill and streaming is quite alright after you get over the initial shock of not having live tv although abc does do live tv hope the other stations follow suit soon overall as a non tech person it was ridiculously easy to hook this up really anyone can do it and like i said if you re comparing other products in the end amazon can not be beat for customer service or support\",\"amazon billing deceptive practices amazon billed my credit card prematurely on payment date for monthly installment andhave no way to contact amazon to request due date on account not happy at all

loved both my paperwhite and voyage is the oasis worth the additional cost update after using my oasis for almost months i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed where it s lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style for my reading elsewhere for example if i want to read while eating i use my voyage w origami case to hold it upright i can read the same book using both singles since they stay synth d to one another and it s given me basically the best of both worlds at least for my style of reading the voyage with cover almost seems clunky bunker and heavier compared to the oasis but when it s sitting on a table it hardly matters i have to say that i m fortunate in being able to afford both and the new base model kindly that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non illuminated display works just fine my original review follows amazon released the first kindly in november of eight and a half years later the oasis model is the th generation kindly and the third evolution of kindly with built in illumination the price of was a bit of a shock but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april th i then spent the next two weeks reading what was available online describing the features and benefits and asking myself whether or not i had made the right decision now that its finally been released and i have it in my hands how different is it and is it worth what appears at first to be a very high price my kindly experience i purchased my first kindly a first generation paperwhite when it was first released in sept i purchased the voyage when it was first released in sept read more\",\"love hate relationship i bought one of the first paperwhites and have been very pleased with it its been a constant companion and i suppose ive read on average a book every three days for the past however many years on it i wouldnt give it up you have to try it from my cold dead fingers for sunday logistical reasons ive also made good use of amazon kindly app on my iphone no paperwhite screen naturally and all the cool usability that delivers but it works well and has its own attractions as a companion to the kindly of course there are aspects of the paperwhite which i would like to critique ah you knew that was coming somewhere didnt you as a member of bookbub i get a daily list of alerts and book deals in my chosen genres i take on many of them however ive found that even with the best will in the world i cant keep up some days it seems that for every book i read ive bought two theres just so much good stuff out there the accumulation effect of this is that the number of books actually on my paperwhite has been creeping ever upward for some time its now at about with this in mind ive noticed that while page turning has remained exactly the same just about every other action on the kindly has become positively glacial not just very slow but so slow you think its malfunctioning the general consensus appears to be that its to be expected once one has that many books downloaded onto a kindly it will begin to behave in a flakes manner this drives me mad amazon states it can hold thousands of books i believe them but i figure i would need a second paperwhite to read while im waiting for actions to complete on the first one read more\",\"love the new kindly love the new kindly priced right with an extra off even smaller in my hands than the kindly with keyboard i was sad to lose my old kindly but this one is just terrific\",\"new kindly buyer thinking about book read on i got my first kindly this is a nice ebook reader i m going to jump right in and tell you what i found to be its pros and cons then i m going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor the barnes noble book simple touch kindly s pros great screen many people do not find lcdb hard to read on e g smartphones tablets kindly fire book color etc but virtually everyone will find e ink easier to read any time of day especially the newest e ink pearl displays they simply look like paper and ink i have never experienced any eye strain reading e ink book readers but i have with lcd based phone tablet screens thin and lightweight this kindly is thinner than any paperback and lighter too this makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position and for long periods too it also makes it easy to transport in a purse backpack or messenger bag or in luggage for traveling many people like to take a few books when travelling and this kindly lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden good value even without a touchscreen the kindly is a good value it is a well made product it offers cloud storage of your books and well it should since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add in micro card the screen is excellent amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing the kindly is the best value of amazon s e ink readers some may be tempted to get the version with the built in light if you can afford it sure go ahead but let me point out you don t have to spend for a fancy schmancy book light your local dollar store has them for wait for it a buck read more\",\"i sent this one back and if you eat or couch read the voyage works best i am a fairly gracious reader books year almost all on kindly i have purchased every kindly edition as soon as it was announced the price doesn t bother me too much as i figure with as much as i read i make the money back by buying kindly vs hardcover books since i mostly read new releases this is the first kindly that i sent back though it s not that the oasis isn t great it is the display is slightly cruiser than previous singles it s not that it isn t set up well the buttons are placed well and easy to use and the touch screen works fine it s really just a matter of personal preference i love to read while i have coffee in the morning and while i m eating lunch at work and because of that i love the origami case that the voyage has it s hard to read the oasis hands free especially if you are used to the voyage also when reading while laying down i switch hands unconscious a couple of times a minute i didn t realize this until i used the oasis because with the oasis you have to flip the kindly over which may not seem like a big deal but it definitely does not create a seamless reading experience so if you like to read while eating or laying down then you are probably better off using the voyage if you want the best looking read then the oasis is great and regardless you are better off reading any kindly than you are watching the garbage on tv\",\"potentially a nice complement to a kindly paperwhite had i not purchased a paperwhite first i could easily settle on the dx as a reader as well as a color tablet the size difference between the two is practically negligible as is the weight difference the dx is slightly larger and about ounces heavier i can hold the the dx in my left hand quite comfortably just not quite as comfortably as the paperwhite moreover the text of the paperwhite seems to wear longer on older tired eyes especially after reading the hype on behalf of e ink text than that of the dx at least during extended stretches of continuous reading still there are moments when my eyes grave color images and videos beyond which the paperwhite can deliver the television set cable and roku box are my wife s and i m no longer doing as well by watching movies or concerts on the severely restricted real estate of an ipod screen all of which doubles the attraction of a tablet like the dx it offers the freedom and privacy of an ipod but with video footage that offers a welcome size advantage compared to the ipod screen for traveling purposes i m good with the paperwhite and an ipod both pocket sized and answering to my reading listening and occasional viewing needs the speakers of the dx may be stereo but they re far from full frequencies perhaps only slightly better than those of a new ipod touch so i d recommend headphones when using either an ipod or the dx as a music player or if your partner won t complain a good adjunct speaker with a supply light cable for better sound and more reliable connectivity than dice bluetooth technology offers i frankly can t see an ipod or tablet performing the many functions of a computer or a camera i m one of the ever more conspicuous minority who still carry a dedicated point and shoot camera but the price point of the dx makes it an affordable luxury device for dedicating to specific and occasional uses i ve met people who no longer use any sort of computer doing all of their facebooking e mail and banking with a mere tablet usually an apple ipad or mini my sense is that the dx would prove slightly more cumbersome for such purposes apple s tablet has the refined processor continually upgraded os and widely established ecosystem to make it a better bet for most users thinking of pitching their laptops aside from the added cost of the apple tablet twice as much as the dx i m simply not excited about tablets in general the affordability of the dx which has now got several years of refinement behind it makes it the preferred choice in my case in conclusion i ve got to rate the paperwhite for my particular uses as well as for amazon s scoring a game changing consumer technology coup second only to the release of the first apple ipod in and the facebook air in though it was not accepted by the general public until apple s decision to ignore the naysayers and release it again in not only is the paperwhite small versatile fast loading and beautifully back lit no more tumbling around and experimenting with various clip on lights but there s no subscription charge for long distance connectivity to amazon and i find it measuring that amazon includes an official no charge on line user s manual for printing out on a mac computer with the dx on the other hand there appears to be no single authoritative and free user s guide instead your choices for instructions are unlimited and i would advise against proceeding intuitively especially if you plan to make use of amazon s uniquely integrated film commentary thanks largely to below head and timely purchase of the popular imdb reference source it may be no drone but in all other respects it stands alone\",\"more evolutionary than revolutionary but worth the upgrade of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this is the fifth e ink kindly reader that i ve bought my wife and i were early adapters of kindly and when we buy a new kindly the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line i loved the original paperwhite with its small size touch screen front lighting and virtual keyboard the all new paperwhite is a definite step up and for me it was worth the move but others will have to decide for themselves if you read a lot and you don t already have one of the newer e ink singles it s definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite if you have the original paperwhite the upgrade is well worth considering although i ve only had the new paperwhite a few hours i m already glad i upgraded here s a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite size it s the same size as the original paperwhite x x the weight has been reduced slightly from ounces to ounces the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand which is how i usually read the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite it will also fit the new one thank you amazon if you buy a case i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic automate function it s much easier to turn the kindly on and off without tumbling for the small power switch lighting the front lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located it didn t bother me but some readers were annoyed by that i couldn t see any shadows in the new paperwhite where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform with the paperwhite s front lighting you ll never need a clip on light even in total darkness read more\",\"great charger one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this is a great charger i like it better than the square ones\",\"i wanted a dedicated e reader and that s what i got people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m a first time kindly owner so i have nothing to compare the latest kindly to i don t own a book i don t own an ipad and in any case that s comparing apples to oranges i don t have a sony e reader this will be a short simple review i received my kindly about a week ago and haven t been able to put it down things i like about my kindly the e ink display is amazing using the way controller is simple and effective page turn speeds are faster than i thought they would be it s lightweight even with the attached cover i have an amazon cover with a built in light page turning buttons are quiet and well placed recharge time is fast i can order a book and start reading it in less than seconds nice portability i can take books with me when i travel for work and not require additional suitcase or baggage fees things i m not too keen on buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly lack of individual number buttons is frustrating power button on the bottom not a bad thing just an odd thing same for the headphones input i usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when i read things i hope change in the future how books are organized when i put a book in a collection which is actually a tag it still appears in the main list it s not actually moved it s merely associated the look of the main screen i d like folders or some other way to display collections ability to create personal screen saves e book pricing though amazon has little control over this still most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback paperback counterparts read more\",\"the most compact kindly yet extremely legible display happy performance update december i had purchased the new kindly paperwhite thinking it would be a vast improvement over this kindly well i had mixed opinions on it you might want to read my review of the paperwhite here http www amazon com review r z sdfocz z refcmcrrdppermbottom line is that the kindly e ink display is for the money an amazing product unless you really do a lot of reading in bed or in dark rooms you don t need the paperwhite at nearly twice the cost i actually returned my paperwhite due to all the screen issues my review of the paperwhite describes all you need to know update september new firmware is available for the kindly it is version as i write this it brings some notable improvements to the kindly experience new features in this update include improved reading font that is higher contrast and cruiser so that you can enjoy a paper like reading experience parental controls that allow you to restrict access to the experimental web browser archived items and the kindly store support for books with complex layouts and formats with kindly format support

kindly store over the next few weeks dictionaries grouped into a collection in home and archived items called dictionaries for better organization improved table and image viewing planning and booming on supported titles the update is available from the kindly support area on amazon web site and now back to my original review read more\",\"worth the money not perfect but very very good for start to finish novels in good light the kindly is my first e ink reader i own an ipad an iphone and have owned a windows based phone in the past that i used as an reader my overall impression of the device is good the good i d honestly rather read linear read from page one to the end one page at a time fiction from it than a book because i can t always get comfortable with a book hardcover are sometimes a bit heavy and paperback don t always lie open easily the kindly is incredibly light and thin i can hold it in one hand easily the page turn buttons are conveniently located page turns aren t instant but they re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book there are just a lot more page turns unless you choose a small font the contrast is better than other readers i ve seen there is zero eye strain in good light my eyesight isn t the greatest and i like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses i love being able to browse the kindly store and read samples before deciding to purchase the experimental browser is surprisingly usable but isn t great it is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs the biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation using the way pad it sync your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iphone or ipad the so so the kindly store could use more categories and sorting options you can t sort by top rated and there is no category for alternate histories for example finding a very specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches which don t do a great job the wifi sometimes doesn t connect before it times out read more\",\"do you just want to read a book than this is the kindly for you people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i have owned a kindly for several years now i have had the nd generation kindly and i have had the kindly keyboard when my mom expressed interest in getting a kindly i decided to give her my kindly keyboard because she doesnt have wifi in her house and my older kindly keyboard had g which is what she needed and i decided to buy the basic kindly for myself because i didnt want to wait for the paperwhite to come out and i just needed wifi and and most importantly i just want to read a book not listen to text to speech or go shopping on amazon or listen to music etc all i want to do is read a book thats it this kindly is perfect for that its smaller and lighter the pages turn faster than the keyboard version it basically has everything i need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the paperwhite or keyboard yes you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindly with a way controller but i rarely use the keyboard anyway to download a book i just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my kindly which is much quicker no matter what version of kindly you have so if you dont need want or use all the extras then i would definitely recommend the basic kindly for with special offers because who really pays attention to the screen saves anyway\",\"kindly vs book updated of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no update november my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as amazon calls it now there are newer models the basic cheap kindly and the kindly touch and of course the kindly fire quasi tablet each of these models is an excellent choice whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences the e ink singles are kindly keyboard this one kindly touch the newest flagship model and the basic kindly all of them have exactly the same display with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no restrain the kindly keyboard is the oldest of these models and i got one of the first ones when they came out in august i still absolutely love my kindly keyboard and use it almost every day i have read dozens of books on it i like the newer models they have some neat features but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my year old kindly keyboard page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest singles but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading in my opinion the touch screen interface of the kindly touch is pretty neat but unlike my ipad i only use my kindly to read books and reading books is just as nice on any of the current kindly models i don t consider the touch screen a must have feature and i m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product i own for that reason i think the cheapest kindly is an excellent choice read more\",\"i was very happy with my paperwhite and would not have bought this since other people have gone into detail on the device i will answer only the burning questions i had before i received mine i was very happy with my paperwhite and would not have bought this had mine not been stolen lost not sure which my husband still has his paperwhite so i was able to compare them side by side can i use the wall charger from my paperwhite to charge the voyages can pressing the page turner cause repetitive use issues don t think so you can turn down the pressure it needs which is very slight or you can turn it off completely and turn pages with a tap it s actually nice to have both options can you see where to turn the pages in the dark you can guess where the page forward area is but the page back is a dot so guessing would be difficult but you can still tap to turn pages using a cover helps as the edge of the cover would be right over the dot does the feedback buzz annoy you when you turn pages think it does take a little getting used to but you can turn it down and i think i will not notice it after a while there s no sound it s purely tactile months later it s not distracting you forget about it is the adjustable light nice still do it manually it doesn t adjust the way i d like it to not as bright in good light as i d like and not as dim while my husband is sleeping next to me note that if you want to use the night light you have to set that separately from auto adjust settings device options screen light i m not actually sure that the night light is working it was at when i turned off the light this is quite bright and i checked it about minutes later and it was at read more\",\"seamless reading experience almost like reading a real book don t is crisp sharp and easy to read i ve held out from buying a reader for years because i could never quite get past the fact it wasn t a book with this new kindly i don t even notice i am immediately immersed wildly better than i expected\",\"trouble free international shipping and easy to convert pub people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no my new kindly paperwhite came from the usa to a small town in sweden in just five days payment of tax and customs handled by amazon had not the ups been so square they think everyone sits at home all day i had received it a day earlier i am very pleased with the e reader easy on the eyes and comfortable to hold in one hand even if i buy many books from amazon i also want to read books in the pub format a positive surprise was how easy it is to convert pub format to amazon s own format i use the program calibre and then i just send the book as an attachment in an e mail to my kindly quick and easy\",\"detailed review of the kindly as has been the case for years amazon sloooowwwwly adds new changes and features to the kindly this one is no exception if you ve used a kindly in the past you re not going to notice much of a change with this one but since there are some minor upgrades and so forth i ll briefly go over them screen the new kindly is touchscreen and has the typical matte finish with the slightly gray off white paper looking background it s certainly not bright white but it s also not lcd looking dark gray it does not have buttons for page turning as the older generations do if you simply must have the page turning buttons please search for the older singles that offer that one last thing regarding the screen this is not a kindly paperwhite or voyage where you have a back lit screen this has an unit off white kindly screen i will say the text is noticeably cruiser and bolder than i ve seen with previous generation singles and i believe that s because amazon is using e ink s new carta displays instead of the previously used pearl displays i love that and have been waiting for years for e ink the taiwan based company that makes the kindly screens for amazon to improve them it looks like they re finally getting it the new kindly s screen resolution is ppi which is slightly lower than the kindly paperwhite which is ppi and substantially lower than the kindly voyage which boasts an impressive ppi individual pixels at this density can not be distinguished by the naked eye price wise though the base model paperwhite runs at the time of this review and the voyage base model runs so you can see the more you pay the better the resolution and features ppi is fine though read more\",\"only lasts for less than year this is the third power charger that i have had to buy at cost of over each since my kindly fire purchase why can t the chargers last a reasonable amount of time when i connected this charger i received a message saying that it was a low level charger it probably would not charge while the kindly was in use not acceptable for this cost\",\"more evolutionary than revolutionary but worth the upgrade this is the fifth e ink kindly reader that i ve bought my wife and i were early adapters of kindly and when we buy a new kindly the old one goes to the next niece or nephew in line i loved the original paperwhite with its small size touch screen front lighting and virtual keyboard the all new paperwhite is a definite step up and for me it was worth the move but others will have to decide for themselves if you read a lot and you don t already have one of the newer e ink singles it s definitely worth upgrading to the paperwhite if you have the original paperwhite the upgrade is well worth considering although i ve only had the new paperwhite a few hours i m already glad i upgraded here s a summary of my initial impressions of the new paperwhite size it s the same size as the original paperwhite x x the weight has been reduced slightly from ounces to ounces the paperwhite is very comfortable to hold in one hand which is how i usually read the really good news is that if you have a case for the original paperwhite it will also fit the new one thank you amazon if you buy a case i highly recommend that the case include the magnetic automate function it s much easier to turn the kindly on and off without tumbling for the small power switch lighting the front lighting is noticeably improved over the original paperwhite which had slightly visible shadows coming from the bottom edge where the led lights were located it didn t bother me but some readers were annoyed by that i couldn t see any shadows in the new paperwhite where the lighting appears brighter and more uniform with the paperwhite s front lighting you ll never need a clip on light even in total darkness read more\",\"perfect for academics i was so shocked so i was going through a book for my phd dissertation highlighting parts for further citations in my project when i was done with it i realised that instead of scrolling back all the pages of my e book looking for the highlights i can just export them to my e mail in pdf file this is life changing for me i have always preferred paper books to e books but this option is a miracle it saved me hours of work i am a very happy customer\",\"best kindly so far people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i bought the first kindly when it came out and while i liked it i didn t use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use the second generation kindly was a lot better but i still preferred to read physical books with the kindly being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space i still buy physical books but most are donated to the local library salvation army etc after i ve read them next about a year after it came out i bought what amazon called the kindly keyboard and was hooked i began using the kindly as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the kindly keyboard couldn t be improved upon i ve since given a couple as gifts i liked the storage capacity the g capability and thought i wouldn t want to be without the keyboard after reading more than seventy books on it i couldn t imagine trying a kindly with less memory and only wi fi i was wrong i ordered this th generation kindly earlier this year thinking i d have it for a backup to my kindly keyboard instead it has become my much preferred device storage room with the cloud it s really not an issue i keep a few reference books on both of my current singles the keyboard and this one as well as what i m currently reading i haven t had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity while it would be nice to have g it s not a deal killer at all i ve already read close to books on this kindly and i ve only found myself without easy access to wi fi once when i m close to finishing a book i plan ahead and download a new one or two so that i m ready wherever i happen to be read more\",\"must have one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no these are great this is my second paperwhite and second charger thinking about a third fourth because while putting fiction on one and non fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a kindly dedicated just to recipes another to health books etc would be marvelous\",\"liked the smaller size had older model that you could text to speech this one hasn t liked the smaller size but having to buy a different cover still getting used to shelf quite different from my year old model paper white is nice reading\",\"i love this little e reader there are sadly a lot of negative reviews on here so i though i would add my positive one i had a second generation kindly many years ago and it has since stopped working i finally decided to buy a new one i chose the basic kindly because that s exactly what i wanted a bare bones e reader i have no need for a tablet or anything of the sort this kindly delivers on that front in every way possible at first i thought i would miss the page turn buttons and dislike the touch screen however i have been delightful surprised tapping the edge of the screen to turn the page is incredibly easy and less intrusive than pushing a button which was always a nice little jarring reminder that i wasn t in fact reading a paperback the small quick tap of my thumb on the edge of the screen has become almost like a reflex and i don t notice it anymore it feels natural i do slightly miss the metal backing of the older singles it made them feel a bit studies whereas this basic kindly is just hard plastic however i suspect that using a metal casing would up the price considerably and i feel that the cheaper price of this basic kindly far outweighs that slight drawback i bit the bullet and bought one without the special offers i do not want ads including my kindly experience even if they only show as the screensaver or on a bar across the bottom of the home screen it is just distasteful to me and the extra was worth it to me to avoid the ads i do not need or want a case for my kindly i do not like to read with a case on and it would be cumbersome to remove my kindly from its case every time i want to read read more\",\"great update for those who use their kindly a lot i m a long time kindly user and have upgraded a number of times every upgrade was a significant improvement and the oasis continues that trend i love my voyage but the oasis makes it feel like a hardback book the pictures and descriptions don t do the size and weight justice shocking light and small even with the case used without the case it s like holding a few sheets of paper amazing haven t had it long enough to evaluate the battery life but never had a problem with the previous models so i assume the promise of much longer battery life with the secondary battery in the case is accurate the balance in the hand without the case is stunning good with the case feels a bit like the voyage although quite a bit lighter than my voyage in its case case is high quality and easy to put on and take off as needed screen seems a side clearer and higher definition than my voyage maybe due to the updated lighting system i had the pressure sensitive page turner option on my voyage turned off much too jump and sensitive even at its hard setting i won t miss that the new mechanical buttons on the oasis are awesome nice upgrade there and nice to not have to touch the screen for the most part yes it is price i would say if you are a few hour a week reader the paperwhite is your best bet solid performance and very good price value but if you are a reading fanatic who reads a lot every day like me the extra battery life and the balance size weight along with the slightly improved screen is well worth the money especially when spread over the life of the unit edit a few more comments now that i ve been using the oasis for a number of months read more\",\"huge upgrade from the kindly keyboard i had a kindly keyboard i still have i m not sure i m ready to part with it i m rather attached the kindly is the e reader it s fantastic i had my kindly keyboard for a couple years and i couldn t imagine reading on anything else there were times i left my kindly at work and had to read on my ipad i hated it however i found the keyboard interface to be cumbersome and just old i wanted something new so onto the paperwhite mine was a gift i have the wifi only version why would you need the g just download several books at once and you are good to go i will say that the paperwhite light is fantastic have you watched the videos on the paperwhite it s not a traditional backlight it does not shine the light towards your eyes but rather down at the screen genius i sit at a computer all day i do not want more light shining at my eyes which is why i loved my kindly keyboard for so long i haven t had the paperwhite very long but i keep it at about a medium brightness so far i love that i can now read in bed with no other light the paperwhite is light weight it s rather small but about the same width as the kindly keyboard i put both singles on the same page of a book and more lines were rendered on the paperwhite than the keyboard but the font isn t smaller somehow more words are fit on the page i like the touchscreen interface i really found the keyboard keys to be tedious i kind of sort of miss the page flip buttons though i loved those since they were on both sides of the kindly they were easily accessible no matter what i was doing at the time or how i was laying imo the jury is still out on whether or not i can live without those buttons so far i m doing ok but i will confess to missing them greatly read more\",\"good value at with a few its i am writing this from the perspective of being a long time experienced kindly user vs someone brand new from an overall perspective considering the pricing of the kindly with special offers at vs higher amounts for the different flavors of kindly available today this one is a bargain if you have wanted to get your kids a kindly to encourage reading as well as sharing of books but hesitated because to is a lot of money to risk with a child maybe at this is your price point from a size standpoint the reading screen is the exact same size as the other e ink singles it is slightly thicker but slightly lighter than the kindly paperwhite but to me it s not really a noticeable difference when you re holding it in a protective cover opening up the box included with the kindly is a micro usb cord but no power adapter that s really annoying interesting and it seems rather chicken of amazon a power adaptor has to be purchased separately for if you purchase it at the same time as you purchase the kindly or if you purchase it later so if you already have a micro usb charger handy i wouldn t order one of the chargers there are no page buttons no buttons at all except for the power button and turning the page is as easy as tapping the side of the screen with your thumb while you re reading or wiping the screen with your finger reading is easy on this one in comparison to my kindly keyboard the previous version of kindly and a kindly dx the letters on the screen are much much darker and easier to read the display is crisp and dark read more\",\"ive loved both my paperwhite and voyage is the oasis worth the additional cost note my original kindly oasis review was posted on on this product page on amazon new kindly oasis e reader with leather charging cover this page is for the same product but for purchasers who wish to use it outside of the u s my original review follows update after using my oasis for almost months i thought i would add a brief comment to my original review i have settled on using the oasis for reading in bed where it s lighter and easier to hold and i prefer the page turn button style for my reading elsewhere for example if i want to read while eating i use my voyage w origami case to hold it upright i can read the same book using both singles since they stay synth d to one another and it s given me basically the best of both worlds at least for my style of reading the voyage with cover almost seems clunky bunker and heavier compared to the oasis but when it s sitting on a table it hardly matters i have to say that i m fortunate in being able to afford both and the new base model kindly that i recently picked up is not yet getting much use even though much of my reading is in lighting conditions where the non illuminated display works just fine my original review follows amazon released the first kindly in november of eight and a half years later the oasis model is the th generation kindly and the third evolution of kindly with built in illumination the price of was a bit of a shock but i ordered mine as soon as it was announced on april th read more\",\"i wanted a

review helpful to you yes no allow me to preface this with a little history i am was a casual reader who owned a book simple touch from i ve read the harry potter series girl with the dragon tattoo series brave new world and a few other key titles fair to say my book did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs fast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindly paperwhite and i have to admit i m in love not just with the kindly but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindly the investment of is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindly you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the book that hindered me for the past years i was never inspired to pick it up get it into my hands and just dive in there was never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply odore my kindly if you are considering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week downloaded books and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left as well make yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you\",\"paperwhite voyage no regrets i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friends who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have ppi so the dollar jump turns out price the voyage s page press isn t always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you don t need auto light adjustment it s been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regrets the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it s not hard to change the setting either as you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery was on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about customs which i may have if i used a third party shipping service\",\"i love it i love my kindly i got one for my fiance on his birthday he loved it so i decided to get one for myself as well and i am glad i did it is very easy to read books in it i love the dictionary on this little device normally i just skip a word i don t know the meaning of and try to guess what it means in the context but with kindly i just press and hold my finger on the word i don t know and translation pops up so essentially the meaning of a new word is at your finger tips if you love to read books i highly recommend kindly however if you only read manga or comic books if you are a fan of buying how to draw how to sew books i do not recommend kindly for you it is not easy to navigate trough pictures and slides so if you are a fan of reading novels just buy it now if you are a manga fan just buy your manga books from bookstores\",\"great entry level reader people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i travel for work more and more i find myself leaving the kindly fire at home and traveling with just an e ink kindly so when i broke my kindly i decided to replace it with this entry level kindly without special offers what s good smallest lightest e ink kindly available still has the page turn buttons like all the e ink singles this thing has amazing battery life what s just ok only gb memory more is better then again after two years of buying books i m nowhere near filling this thing up text entry using the way switch works but that s about all i m surprised it works well enough that i can t consider it a negative what s not so good the lighted cover costs nearly as much as the kindly anyone thinking of picking up this kindly and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight the new singles look awesome but they don t take anything away from this kindly it may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less the kindly is exactly what i need for traveling it works wonderfully as a basic no fills e reader reviewing it as such i have to give it five stars\",\"i m very glad that i made this purchase i m very glad that i made this purchase i don t often bring my computer with me when i travel i enjoy having the option of using a standard outlet to charge the paperwhite\",\"must have these are great this is my second paperwhite and second charger thinking about a third fourth because while putting fiction on one and non fiction on other have been thinking how great to have a kindly dedicated just to recipes another to health books etc would be marvelous\",\"a great product that s now even better if you re reading reviews of the new rd generation paperwhite you re likely considering buying one if so you re probably in one of these categories never owned a kindly e ink reader own an older kindly e ink reader but not a paperwhite own a first or second generation paperwhitei ll save my opinion on whether the new paperwhite is worth buying until the end of my review but i will say this they ve taken a great product and made it even better first here s a comparison of the new paperwhite with the second generation paperwhite comparisons are for the wi fi models second generation paperwhite size x x weight wi fi

size x x weight wi fi version ouncesdisplay diagonal pixels per inch level grayscale led frontlitstorage memory page turns touchscreennumber of fonts display lighting manually adjustable front lightingnote that the physical size is identical to the older paperwhite so covers and sleeves that worked with the older paperwhites are still usable thank you amazon the most obvious difference is the screen resolution pixels per inch is a major jump from the pixels per inch in the older paperwhites read more\",\"know what you are buying i ve had this kindly for a while now many of the reviews say it all so i don t think i could add much but i feel like i need to speak on behalf of this kindly to shield it from reviewers and owners who seem to have no idea what they bought if this could help clear up any confusion for a first time buyer then writing this is worth it so i have to begin by asking reviewers that confuse us also you have any clue what you bought let s all say it out loud this kindly does not have a light it is an entry level model with no light amazon has always sold non lighted singles and i still have many of them they are a cheap way to get into the e reader scene can you read a real book in the dark of course not so these non lighted singles are not epic failures for not having a light just as the last novel you bought was not an epic failure for not having a built in light it is ridiculous to buy this kindly then give it a star review because it doesn t have a light read the product descriptions this kindly has no light the paperwhite and voyage do scream all to the heavens this kindly does not have page turning buttons to buy this kindly then give it a star review because your old kindly had page turning buttons and this one does not is insane could you not see when you clicked on buy that this kindly had no page turning buttons sometimes i think there are two kinds of kindly owners those who want page turning buttons and those who don t mind moving their thumb a nano meter to turn a page if you can tell by my sarcasm i belong to the latter bunch then of course there are the technically deficient that have no clue what wifi is are unable to sign on and blame it on the kindly bam another star review read more\",\"great for those that just want an e reader people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i am enjoying it so far great for reading had the original fire since the fire used to make my eyes hurt if i read too long haven t experienced that with the paperwhite yet\",\"fantastic device pick your kindly having been a little overwhelmed by the choices between all the new singles and which one to get i ordered this new basic kindly first to take for a spin so far i like what i see i also own a kindly so that s the only device i can really compare it to at this time i think a comparison between other tablets and this kindly is meaningless this device is all about content and delivery form factor compared to the kindly this kindly feels more compact lighter and easier to hold my hands wrap around this better than k reading books for a few hours at a stretch will be easier on this device compared to the k it is the lightest such device i have used compared to all previous singles and other tablets screen i personally like the fact that there are no keys on the device and that keys come up on the screen when you need them delivers a better overall reading experience however navigating through the on screen keyboard with the way controller can be taxing if you need to do a lot of searching and you might miss the full physical keyboard i hardly search on the kindly itself i search for books on my laptop so this is a non issue price at you can t go wrong compared to buying paperback or hardcover editions you will recover the cost of this in a matter of a few months because most kindly content is priced cheaper than print editions and you get it instantly and can access it wherever you are not to mention all the free kindly downloads available in the catalog display almost the same e ink display at the k no glare no reflection you can sit in bright sunlight and read it just like a book page turns seem a lot faster on this compared to the k read more\",\"a resistant buyer rejoice on his choice i researched the purchase of a kindly for a long time i couldn t decide whether or not it was worth buying a dedicated e reader boy am i glad i made this purchase the downside to amazon s online selling of kindly is that the customers don t get to see it in person it is much better in person this may sound stupid but when i got my new kindly i thought there was a stuck on overlay on the screen containing a diagram of the unit s buttons etc i actually tried to peel it off doh the e ink on this unit is that good i didn t realize that i was staring at the actual display i also didn t realize that no power is required until the display changes thus the great battery life i do a lot of reading but was facing the prospect of reading less or buying large type books because of my variable and deteriorating eyesight the new kindly has been a godsend now i can decide the size of type i need depending on my level of fatigue among other things the weight and economics are very good for someone like me with neuropathy in his hands it is extremely easy to manage and enjoyable to own to me it is easier to read than print books the ease of navigation is great as is the speed the battery life so far has been extraordinary it easily connected to our home wi fi which by design does not broadcast an said it downloads books so fast that i almost thought they were not completely received i did not buy the g version because of the price difference and the fact that there is no coverage where i live if you are not constantly traveling i don t see the need to spend the extra bucks but that is a matter of personal choice for those who have no wi fi at home remember that you can always download the material to your computer and transfer it via usb read more\",\"best kindly so far i bought the first kindly when it came out and while i liked it i didn t use it that much because the page turn buttons could be too easily triggered and the cover was somewhat clumsy to use the second generation kindly was a lot better but i still preferred to read physical books with the kindly being a solution for being able to have books available without taking up any more space i still buy physical books but most are donated to the local library salvation army etc after i ve read them next about a year after it came out i bought what amazon called the kindly keyboard and was hooked i began using the kindly as a preferred reading medium over physical books and thought that the kindly keyboard couldn t be improved upon i ve since given a couple as gifts i liked the storage capacity the g capability and thought i wouldn t want to be without the keyboard after reading more than seventy books on it i couldn t imagine trying a kindly with less memory and only wi fi i was wrong i ordered this th generation kindly earlier this year thinking i d have it for a backup to my kindly keyboard instead it has become my much preferred device storage room with the cloud it s really not an issue i keep a few reference books on both of my current singles the keyboard and this one as well as what i m currently reading i haven t had any problem with coming close to exceeding the storage capacity while it would be nice to have g it s not a deal killer at all i ve already read close to books on this kindly and i ve only found myself without easy access to wi fi once when i m close to finishing a book i plan ahead and download a new one or two so that i m ready wherever i happen to be read more\",\"i wanted a dedicated e reader and that s what i got of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m a first time kindly owner so i have nothing to compare the latest kindly to i don t own a book i don t own an ipad and in any case that s comparing apples to oranges i don t have a sony e reader this will be a short simple review i received my kindly about a week ago and haven t been able to put it down things i like about my kindly the e ink display is amazing using the way controller is simple and effective page turn speeds are faster than i thought they would be it s lightweight even with the attached cover i have an amazon cover with a built in light page turning buttons are quiet and well placed recharge time is fast i can order a book and start reading it in less than seconds nice portability i can take books with me when i travel for work and not require additional suitcase or baggage fees things i m not too keen on buttons are too close together and are laid out oddly lack of individual number buttons is frustrating power button on the bottom not a bad thing just an odd thing same for the headphones input i usually rest the bottom of a book on my lap when i read things i hope change in the future how books are organized when i put a book in a collection which is actually a tag it still appears in the main list it s not actually moved it s merely associated the look of the main screen i d like folders or some other way to display collections ability to create personal screen saves e book pricing though amazon has little control over this still most titles are the same price as or less than their hardback paperback counterparts read more\",\"kindly vs book updated update november br br my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as amazon calls it now there are newer models the basic cheap kindly and the kindly touch and of course the kindly fire quasi tablet br br each of these models is an excellent choice whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences br br the e ink singles are kindly keyboard this one kindly touch the newest flagship model and the basic kindly all of them have exactly the same display with the same sharp typeface and high contrast that reads like ink on paper with no restrain the kindly keyboard is the oldest of these models and i got one of the first ones when they came out in august br br i still absolutely love my kindly keyboard and use it almost every day i have read dozens of books on it i like the newer models they have some neat features but the experience of reading a book on them is no better or worse than on my year old kindly keyboard page turns are now smoother and faster on the newest singles but the difference is not enough to make it worth the cost of upgrading in my opinion br br the touch screen interface of the kindly touch is pretty neat but unlike my ipad i only use my kindly to read books and reading books is just as nice on any of the current kindly models i don t consider the touch screen a must have feature and i m normally obsessed with having the latest version of every tech product i own br br for that reason i think the cheapest kindly is an excellent choice read more\",\"easy to read and very light but was frustrated with a few things this is my th kindly since i bought my first one as soon as kindly was launched with every new model i was fascinated by the improvements and kept recommending them to friends the voyager was the first time i felt somewhat frustrated with an amazon product yes it is lighter and even easier to read than my previous models if you are buying your first one don t hesitate it is still a great product and still much more comfortable to use than trying to read a book on an ipad even if it is an ipad mini but there are a few things that i thing amazon should fix on this one specially because it is the top of the line kindly the battery cover just keeps disconnecting from the reader itself the magnetic attachment is just not strong enough to keep it in position as you manipulate the reader previous covers just stayed in place and even the apple magnetic cover attaches better than this one as you are able to turn off the page buttons on the side you should be able to turn off page turning on the screen the way i got used to handle the kindly and as i constantly change hands when i am reading i get a lot of desired page turns because i touched the screen somewhere a very simple fix that could be in one of the next software updates that would greatly improve my perception of the device battery life even with the cover is far from what i expected my old kindly had a battery that lasted for more than a month the new one needs charging every days the device itself is so light and the battery cover so cumbersome that it should come with a simple e cover just to protect the screen when you throw it in the bag read more\",\"ruined my marriage this thing has captured my wife s heart she reads every where all the time vacation on the way to church at bedside and far beyond books are so easy to get from the kindly itself it fits in her purse i have to repeat everything i always get right after this chapter do not buy this for someone you want share life with\",\"i wanted a dedicated e reader and that s what i got i m a first

that just want an e reader i am enjoying it so far great for reading had the original fire since the fire used to make my eyes hurt if i read too long haven t experienced that with the paperwhite yet\",\"worth the money not perfect but very very good for start to finish novels in good light the kindly is my first e ink reader i own an ipad an iphone and have owned a windows based phone in the past that i used as an reader br br my overall impression of the device is good br br the good br i d honestly rather read linear read from page one to the end one page at a time fiction from it than a book because i can t always get comfortable with a book hardcover are sometimes a bit heavy and paperback don t always lie open easily the kindly is incredibly light and thin i can hold it in one hand easily the page turn buttons are conveniently located page turns aren t instant but they re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book there are just a lot more page turns unless you choose a small font the contrast is better than other readers i ve seen there is zero eye strain in good light my eyesight isn t the greatest and i like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses i love being able to browse the kindly store and read samples before deciding to purchase the experimental browser is surprisingly usable but isn t great it is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs the biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation using the way pad it sync your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iphone or ipad br br the so so br the kindly store could use more categories and sorting options you can t sort by top rated and there is no category for alternate histories for example finding a very specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches which don t do a great job the wifi sometimes doesn t connect before it times out read more\",\"works great and i love the built in

kindly is the perfect balance of book and digital format short reviews you should buy a kindly get the paperwhite with no ads you re welcome long review love physical books too i m with you but i know myself and i know that once i forget to take the book i m reading with me that s it i ll start another book and rarely finish the first i also know if i try and read on my phone or ipad that i ll get distracted and start wondering about what s happening on the internet instagram s not gon na scroll itself either way i m not finishing the book why kindlethe kindly takes the best of both worlds and dashes them together the e ink display is honestly incredible i wish phones had an e ink display it really looks just like a printed page so you get the experience of reading a physical paper book but with the parks of being digital namely share what book you re reading to goodreads facebook or twitter so you can look short built in dictionary so you can learn the proper spelling of the word short export your highlights as a pdfplus it ll also sync with the kindly app on your phone so you can squeeze in the final few pages of the chapter while you re in the bathroom don t pretend you don t do that you re either on your phone or you re reading the freeze ingredients reading in beetle backlight looks great it s a perfect size read more\",\"love my singles i have now owned singles and just love them my first one lasted for years and then died of old age and overuse i had used it so much the printed keypads were all blank i then got kindly fires i gave one to my daughter and kept the other i have had no problem with the fire once i broke down and read some of the direction if all else fails other than operator error i have used it for over a year but it s too heavy for my old overuse hands not heavy though books now give me problems even paperback but i then bought the smaller lighter new kindly and loved it from the first i carried in my purse a lot so it froze after a few months i called customer support and they replaced it with a refurbished one this time i bought a light weight cover for it i don t like the added weight of the cover but in order for me to never leave home without it i have to protect it i have had this one for months and have had no problems i now have about books awaiting my pleasure i just looked the singles over again i m getting paranoid about my little kindly and am considering having an on site backup although amazon would get me one here in just a couple of days still giving it thought basically i love my singles and use both of my current ones for different apps\",\"five stars meet my needs but feel should be supplied when actually purchasing the oasis e reader\",\"i had a kindly before found it very easy to find what i needed to do only stars because i found it very confusing at first i had a kindly before found it very easy to find what i needed to do the user guide didn t really answer my questions but i persisted am getting used to it i really love the blacklist screen no buttons to push to change pages at first i wasn t sure about the smaller screen but didn t take long to get over that i m sure i m just a creature of habit not very tech all in all the kindly paperwhite is great\",\"not the perfect do it all device but very close to being the perfect e reading device i woke up to a nice surprise this morning a new kindly as a gift i have an ipad and a kindly dx but i guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended reading on don t get me wrong i absolutely love my ipad and dx but this new generation of kindly is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time the ipad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritated my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours the dx was my go to device for those extended outdoor reading periods but now i have a new friend for reading novels instead of a replacement this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class the ipad works great for web browsing shopping productivity games etc while the kindly falls short in those areas the kindly works great for reading novels where the ipad falls short for those that love to do extended reading of magazines newspapers research articles etc i find that the dx is the go to device without a doubt the size and weight of the new kindly is the biggest draw for me it s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin i ve played around with the kindly and was impressed but now looking at the size of the new kindly i m blown away it s the absolute perfect size smaller would be manageable and larger wouldn t feel nearly as good this is a device that you can hold up read and just forget that it s there compared to other e readers i ve tried it s much smaller and much lighter one of my biggest complaints about the previous generation singles and the dx is the speed it sometimes takes a while after you push next page for it to actually change read more\",\"good as a first paperwhite not worthy of an upgrade this review is for the second generation kindly paperwhite like all kindly e readers before it this is a great product however i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year s model for this review i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year s model also i found something misrepresented or confusing in the advertising so i will try to clear them up hardwaredesign the kindly white has a nice look and shape it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand it s fairly light so it doesn t tire the hands too much i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite almost identical the height and width are the same the buttons are in the same location and although this version is slightly lighter it is not noticeable display although not a huge improvement from last year s model the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite like most e readers the paperwhite uses digital ink technology this model employs a more advanced version in addition the lighting has been upgraded so among other things it is more evenly lit together they make for incredible viewing in my opinion it s one of the best digital ink e reader display on the market i really enjoy reading on it text look very sharp and crisp with little to no eye strain processor the paperwhite has an upgraded processor which means smoother page turns and navigation i am able to open books flip pages and navigate menus fairly quickly there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time also the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all read more\",\"adequate i do find this better than the cheaper version i bought initially at staples it charges faster but not as fast as the kindly charger that i had used for a couple years before it finally gave out also it is not possible to charge and still use your kindly something i was able to do with the previous charger a feature i really miss still better than the alternative\",\"this is my second kindly i also have a g kindly touch and of the two i prefer the touch overall features i like about the fire i love and hate the carousel all at the same time i love how easy it is to scan through the books that i have on my kindly and seeing the pictures of the covers because sometimes i like to pick my books based solely on the cover i don t like how every book i purchase shows up on the carousel whether i ve sent it to the fire or not there may be a way to stop that from happening but i haven t figured it out yet if there is i really like having my fire connected to my goodreads account so that when i finish reading a book on the fire and write a review for amazon it also posts to goodreads for me without any extra work on my part i also like being able to read on my fire without an additional light source i do not like the glare on the screen while trying to read in sunlight for me the fire has been basically useless anywhere that sunlight is involved which includes car rides on sunny days as the sun shining through the car windows creates too much glare to read i ve seen some people mention a way to sort of solve that problem but i have yet to figure out how to do it and instead just take my touch with me if i m going to possibly anywhere near sunlight\",\"kindly vs book updated people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no update november my review is now over a year old as is the kindly keyboard as amazon calls it now there are newer models the basic cheap kindly and the kindly touch and of course the kindly fire quasi tablet each of these models is an excellent choice whichever one is right for you just depends on your preferences the e ink singles are kindly keyboard this one kindly

this review helpful to you yes no i have loved and used my kindly keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark i purchased a kindly fire and i also use an ipad but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindly keyboard i wanted to get a kindly paperwhite e reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money i got this because i wanted to reduce my restrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced restrain and high clarity and contrast of the text i have added a video of the kindly paperwhite compared to a kindly keyboard and a kindly fire if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear i use the kindly because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it the kindly has brought back that reading experience and now with the cruiser text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment i laid my kindly keyboard and the new kindly paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding with better contrast lighting and custom designed fonts the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e reader before with ppi pixels per inch this screen provides a by pixel screen that just makes the old kindly keyboard look old fashioned technology certainly does move quickly on read more\",\"paperwhite voyage no regrets people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i initially had trouble deciding between the paperwhite and the voyage because reviews more or less said the same thing the paperwhite is great but if you have spending money go for the voyage fortunately i had friends who owned each so i ended up buying the paperwhite on this basis both models now have ppi so the dollar jump turns out price the voyage s page press isn t always sensitive and if you are fine with a specific setting you don t need auto light adjustment it s been a week and i am loving my paperwhite no regrets the touch screen is receptive and easy to use and i keep the light at a specific setting regardless of the time of day in any case it s not hard to change the setting either as you ll only be changing the light level at a certain time of day not every now and then while reading also glad that i went for the international shipping option with amazon extra expense but delivery was on time with tracking and i didnt need to worry about customs which i may have if i used a third party shipping service\",\"do you just want to read a book than this is the kindly for you i have owned a kindly for several years now i have had the nd generation kindly and i have had the kindly keyboard when my mom expressed interest in getting a kindly i decided to give her my kindly keyboard because she doesnt have wifi in her house and my older kindly keyboard had g which is what she needed and i decided to buy the basic kindly for myself because i didnt want to wait for the paperwhite to come out and i just needed wifi and and most importantly i just want to read a book not listen to text to speech or go shopping on amazon or listen to music etc all i want to do is read a book thats it this kindly is perfect for that its smaller and lighter the pages turn faster than the keyboard version it basically has everything i need to download a book and read a book with a much better price than the paperwhite or keyboard yes you have to navigate through the keyboard on this kindly with a way controller but i rarely use the keyboard anyway to download a book i just search and buy books on my computer and send them to my kindly which is much quicker no matter what version of kindly you have so if you dont need want or use all the extras then i would definitely recommend the basic kindly for with special offers because who really pays attention to the screen saves anyway\",\"great device for reading people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no my previous kindly was a dx this is my second kindly in years love the form factor and all but i do miss the physical buttons for page turning there is a glitch in the software though i use the english interface but occasionally i would like to translate words into traditional chinese however it seems that the traditional chinese characters can not display correctly and become small boxes the simplified chinese characters can be displayed correctly though\",\"your kindly has an email address use it this is the third kindly i have bought i bought one for my father and now this one is for my girlfriend one little known feature of the kindly is your get your own kindly com email address when you buy one you can use this email address to email books to yourself or to other people i routinely download mob and pub books online and email them to myself and to my dad and soon my girlfriend within seconds they will magically appear on your kindly s home page\",\"give this to a book loving new tommy who breastfeeds people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no as reviewed by the wife this is the perfect thing for a new tommy who loves to read books as soon as i had my baby girl i had to stop reading my novels because i had to give the baby my full attention but how much time do i spend laying in bed on my side with the baby while she feeds especially prior to months when feeding took as long as minutes not to mention cluster feeds during growth sports a book was out of the question because it s soon tiring to hold up in side lying breastfeeding position my new kindly was the solution it s light easy to disinfect i use baby wives on the case whenever i feel like it s not clean enough to go on the bed with the baby and you don t need to keep a finger in the middle of the pages to keep it from closing you know what i mean and for some reason it s much easier to go through a book with a kindly compared to an actual book i never thought i d be converted into the kindly culture but here we are\",\"facts to consider when buying this kindly instead of others first off i received my new kindly this morning i previously owned the kindly keyboard but actually really didn t like the keyboard or the way the buttons were pressed together i m not a fan of touch screens so i bought this one there are a few things to know about this particular kindly that can help you decide if it s right for you here is a list of things to know about this kindly you ll be using an onscreen keyboard with the way controller this is not a problem for setting up wifi and a little writing but if you are an avid note taker or do a lot of writing with your kindly you might want to opt for the kindly keyboard no audio if you are planning on listening to audiobook mp s or text to speech on your kindly this is not the device for you there is not even a headphones jack so there is absolutely no audio support gb this device has gb of storage which is half of all the others if you seriously need to keep over books or so on your kindly you should opt for one of the others all of which have gb i only keep a hundred or so books on mine and the rest are up in the amazon cloud waiting for convenient download there s no g version but the wifi works just fine there is a shorter battery life amazon reports the battery life is only one month of reading compared with the others that clock in at two months if you are going to be away from electricity for over a month first of all respect second of all you may want a kindly that has the month battery life it s lighter than all the other versions it weighs in at just under oz g the closest competition is the kindly touch which is about oz it has buttons on the face at the bottom read more\",\"worth the money not perfect but very very good for start to finish novels in good light of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no the kindly is my first e ink reader i own an ipad an iphone and have owned a windows based phone in the past that i used as an reader my overall impression of the device is good the good i d honestly rather read linear read from page one to the end one page at a time fiction from it than a book because i can t always get comfortable with a book hardcover are sometimes a bit heavy and paperback don t always lie open easily the kindly is incredibly light and thin i can hold it in one hand easily the page turn buttons are conveniently located page turns aren t instant but they re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book there are just a lot more page turns unless you choose a small font the contrast is better than other readers i ve seen there is zero eye strain in good light my eyesight isn t the greatest and i like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses i love being able to browse the kindly store and read samples before deciding to purchase the experimental browser is surprisingly usable but isn t great it is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs the biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation using the way pad it sync your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iphone or ipad the so so the kindly store could use more categories and sorting options you can t sort by top rated and there is no category for alternate histories for example finding a very specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches which don t do a great job the wifi sometimes doesn t connect before it times out read more\",\"know what you are buying redux if you read the know what you are buying review for the kindly prior to this one then you know where i am going already this new kindly is riddled with one star reviews from people that seem to not have read the product description here goes this kindly does not have a light this kindly does not have gaming capability this kindly does not have page turning buttons like a regular book you just might have a hard time reading this kindly in bed at night with low lighting what you will get though is an awesome entry level kindly with software almost identical to the higher end models the print looks flawless outside by a window or under a lamp in other words just like a real book\",\"a great addition to the kindly range i already had an original kindly paperwhite and loved it buying this in addition seemed like a bit of an indulgence but i am so pleased i made this move i love the new font and the clarity of the screen i love that the kindly comes to life when i open the cover i bought a new cover with the magnetic clasp while there is nothing dramatic about the evolving of the kindly there are enough changes and improvements for me to feel i have made a great purchase which i am happy with i also have a bunch of books from my amazon co uk site which i access on my old kindly i couldn t work out how if at all i can move books from one amazon jurisdiction to another so this has proved a good purchase all round\",\"i love it i have to say upfront i don t like corporate hermetically closed stuff like anything by apple or in this case amazon i like having devices on which i can put anything i want and use it but i was a fairly happy user of a book touch for several years but couldn t use all its functionalities since i live in serbia then i lost the book and since no other devices can actually be fully used in serbia buying books with them using their online capabilities except the kindly and since no one except amazon ships to serbia and since i ve actually been a happy amazon customer since over friends accounts and since through my own and since the kindly definitely has the best technology why not buy its i did what i read in many reviews about the screen light of the paperwhite and similar devices was no problem with mine the light dispersed just fine except a few black blotches maybe you can see it in the picture at the bottom of the screen which are actually shadows of the black plastic casing and thus can t really be avoided as you can see in the picture without the light there are no blotches with light out the paperwhite s screen is just marvelous at ppi the touchscreen works just fine the store works here in serbia and in these two days i ve been using it i m a happy guy i had to get the hang on how to make sideloaded books behave at least almost like amazon books but that s fine that s the one thing i d like to see amazon do in some future upgrades make the kindly treat sideloaded books just like the ones bought from them directly with sharing function quotes and goodreads enabled and so on the size is perfect it sits very well in the hand the light doesn t hurt the eyes in the dark like the light on a tab does the packaging was fine no problems there and what remains to be seen now is the battery life so far i can only recommend it\",\"love love love so happy i don t know why there are so many bad reviews first of let s start off by pointing out the obvious it s under you re not going to receive a kindly paperwhite before you order read the specs and compare it to the other singles yes the specs say it doesn t have backlighting so honestly there shouldn t be one ounce of surprise when you receive this i on the other hand love this little kindly i have had the new kindly paperwhite and i really didn t like how big it was to hold in my small hands i don t have children hands but i m a female and my hands are on the small side maybe for a male this would be kind of small id anyway it is smaller than the paperwhite but i love that i also love the fact that it doesn t come with a light i used to read at night with the paperwhite but that light gave me a headache so i stopped it is not as dark as these bad reviews make it seem you can read perfectly fine being indoors they re exaggeration this feels more like a book to me than the kindly paperwhite ever did the letters on this kindly are amazing i don t even notice the difference between ppi and i love that the letters are way darker than the paperwhite the paperwhite had a grey hue to them and i didn t feel like i was reading a book i felt like i actually holding a technical device to read a book of course since this doesn t have a backlight you can not read in the dark it s common sense if you want to read at night purchase a little book light that are super inexpensive and attach it to your kindly it s not a big deal and you re not going to break the bank buying a item when you can buy this little awesome e book reader for think about when the light runs out of your expensive other e books read more\",\"great entry level reader i travel for work more and more i find myself leaving the kindly fire at home and traveling with just an e ink kindly so when i broke my kindly i decided to replace it with this entry level kindly without special offers what s good smallest lightest e ink kindly available still has the page turn buttons like all the e ink singles this thing has amazing battery life what s just ok only gb memory more is better then again after two years of buying books i m nowhere near filling this thing up text entry using the way switch works but that s about all i m surprised it works well enough that i can t consider it a negative what s not so good the lighted cover costs nearly as much as the kindly anyone thinking of picking up this kindly and the lighted cover should look at the new paper white models with integrated frontlight the new singles look awesome but they don t take anything away from this kindly it may not have some of the bells and whistles of the other models but it also costs quite a bit less the kindly is exactly what i need for traveling it works wonderfully as a basic no fills e reader reviewing it as such i have to give it five stars\",\"i have read some of the previous reviews and you shouldn t believe everything that is written first i m a die hard kindly user and love every single one i have owned this one is incredibly light weight i bought the kindly fire hd before this one and even though i loved it it was pretty heavy the screen resolution is incredible it s crystal clear and just looks amazing now i kind of was debating waiting for the to come out but this inch is the prefect size to throw in my purse i read previous reviews that stated there is a purple border around the edges of the book your reading i don t have that and find that reading a book with this kindly is easy on the eyes i haven t used the monday button yet but i m sure it s up to par with amazon s wonderful customer service i m unsure what else to say but that you will be highly impressed with this kindly\",\"not the perfect do it all device but very close to being the perfect e reading device i woke up to a nice surprise this morning a new kindly as a gift i have an ipad and a kindly dx but i guess someone heard my complaints of them being too heavy and difficult to do extended reading on don t get me wrong i absolutely love my ipad and dx but this new generation of kindly is perfect for reading outside and for long periods of time the ipad gets completely washed out in sunlight and often irritated my eyes staring at it for more than a couple of hours the dx was my go to device for those extended outdoor reading periods but now i have a new friend for reading novels instead of a replacement this one seems more like a companion to the other devices and is a different class the ipad works great for web browsing shopping productivity games etc while the kindly falls short in those areas the kindly works great for reading novels where the ipad falls short for those that love to do extended reading of magazines newspapers research articles etc i find that the dx is the go to device br br without a doubt the size and weight of the new kindly is the biggest draw for me it s smaller than the last edition by a significant margin i ve played around with the kindly and was impressed but now looking at the size of the new kindly i m blown away it s the absolute perfect size smaller would be manageable and larger wouldn t feel nearly as good this is a device that you can hold up read and just forget that it s there compared to other e readers i ve tried it s much smaller and much lighter br br one of my biggest complaints about the previous generation singles and the dx is the speed it sometimes takes a while after you push next page for it to actually change read more\",\"good as a first paperwhite not worthy of an upgrade of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this review is for the second generation kindly paperwhite like all kindly e readers before it this is a great product however i am a bit disappointed as there is not a huge improvement over last year s model for this review i focused on features and enhancements exclusive to the new paperwhite and tried to make comparisons to last year s model also i found something misrepresented or confusing in the advertising so i will try to clear them up hardwaredesign the kindly white has a nice look and shape it fits well and is easy to hold in one hand it s fairly light so it doesn t tire the hands too much i can grip it for long periods before having to switching hands its design is very similar to the previous paperwhite almost identical the height and width are the same the buttons are in the same location and although this version is slightly lighter it is not noticeable display although not a huge improvement from last year s model the display is one of the best features of the paperwhite like most e readers the paperwhite uses digital ink technology this model employs a more advanced version in addition the lighting has been upgraded so among other things it is more evenly lit together they make for incredible viewing in my opinion it s one of the best digital ink e reader display on the market i really enjoy reading on it text look very sharp and crisp with little to no eye strain processor the paperwhite has an upgraded processor which means smoother page turns and navigation i am able to open books flip pages and navigate menus fairly quickly there is barely any lag as i flip through many pages at a time also the flashing effect when turning pages shows up less if at all read more\",\"a new step forward for me in reading on my kindly i have loved and used my kindly keyboard for years now but i missed not being able to read it in a room with low lighting or in the dark i purchased a kindly fire and i also use an ipad but for ease of reading on my eyes i prefer the kindly keyboard i wanted to get a kindly paperwhite e reader but i held off until this new generation was released before i spent my money i got this because i wanted to reduce my restrain from reading in the evening and i just love this new tablet it offers the perfect balance of a lit screen with reduced restrain and high clarity and contrast of the text i have added a video of the kindly paperwhite compared to a kindly keyboard and a kindly fire if you have any questions please feel free to contact me and i will try to answer them i love that the text on the screen is crisp and clear i use the kindly because my declining vision caused me to stop reading books reading was my number one hobby my entire life and i just loved it the kindly has brought back that reading experience and now with the cruiser text and lit screen i can enjoy my reading in every type of environment i laid my kindly keyboard and the new kindly paperwhite side by side and the comparison of the quality of text and clarity is amazingly in favor of the new paperwhite the new lighting system and screen clarity is where this paperwhite design really is outstanding with better contrast lighting and custom designed fonts the text just pops out of the screen like you have not seen in an e reader before with ppi pixels per inch this screen provides a by pixel screen that just makes the old kindly keyboard look old fashioned technology certainly does move quickly on read more\",\"great i use to hate to read but now that i have my kindly and i can change the size of the font so this old lady can see the words better i love to read\",\"the best kindly ever and i should know i ve tried them all i have owned literally and i mean literally every kindly since the first one all the keyboard versions that followed the first one the touch the paperwhite the voyage all the fires since the first one all the different sizes from to and every gen in between i know i am a little crazy many of these are still in use among family members and my habit was to switch between fires depending on mood my last attempt was an ipad mini used only as an reader and for the first time in many years i bought books from somewhere other than amazon because i found the books experience so pleasant bottom line i was always seeking a kindly that fit all my needs as a book and nothing more stop the press i have found it lets put a little context around this i eventually migrated to the fires because although i liked the link for reading i also liked to see more detail on book covers and black and white didn t seem to offer that the paperwhite and it s successors got closer so that even without color the detail was sufficient to make browsing by cover satisfactory something i have always done even with real books still though what i didn t like about the link versions was the inability to render a page without big gaps between words or even truncated lines when there was a big or hyphenated word in the line i don t know whether it is just coincidence that i haven t seen that yet with the oasis or whether the amazon member font helps i like this new font a lot or whether it has been specifically addressed in the newer os whatever i have not seen that yet and it removes one of my reasons for preferring a tablet over an reader first impressions not great read more\",\"one simply could not ask for more allow me to preface this with a little history i am was a casual reader who owned a book simple touch from i ve read the harry potter series girl with the dragon tattoo series brave new world and a few other key titles fair to say my book did not get as much use as many others may have gotten from theirs fast forward to today i have had a full week with my new kindly paperwhite and i have to admit i m in love not just with the kindly but with reading all over again now let me relate this review love and reading all back to the kindly the investment of is in the experience you will receive when you buy a kindly you are not simply paying for a screen there is an entire experience included in buying from amazon i have been reading the hunger games trilogy and shall be moving onto the divergent series soon after here is the thing with the book that hindered me for the past years i was never inspired to pick it up get it into my hands and just dive in there was never that feeling of oh man reading on this thing is so awesome however with my paperwhite i now have that feeling that desire is back and i simply odore my kindly if you are considering purchasing one stop thinking about it simply go for it after a full week downloaded books and a ton of reading i still have half of my battery left as well make yourself happy inspire the reader inside of you\",\"the state of the art e ink reader but is it worth the money to upgrade although i ve owned almost every model of kindly ebook readers since the nd generation kindly that i bought in i had to think hard about ordering the new voyage i was very happy with my paperwhite the nd generation that was released in the fall of and as much as i wanted to try the voyage i wasn t sure i wanted to spend on one it became a moot point though when my wife ordered the voyage saying it was her early christmas present to me now that i ve had time to use the voyage i have to say i m impressed with hardware features like a ppi display led that automatically adjust the screen brightness depending on the ambient lighting and the user s choice of a touchscreen or sensors acting like buttons to turn pages the voyage is hands down the state of the art e ink ebook reader at the end of my review i ll give my opinion on whether it s worth upgrading from your current ebook reader when i received the voyage the setup was quick although you do have to go through a brief tutorial and after downloading a few of my books from the amazon cloud and adjusting a few settings the voyage was ready to go here s a brief comparison of the voyage and the paperwhite voyage size x x weight wi fi version ouncesdisplay diagonal pixels per

upgraded dpi screen more memory and storage it s a terrific reading device this review aims to describe both this product and compare it with the other kindly devices available to help you choose the best one for you before i start ive noticed several complains about kindly not supporting the pub format used by canadian public libraries dont be put off theres a solution in the frequently asked questions section below this review is broken up into sections so you can skip the less interesting bits if youre in a hurry ive included a summary at the start and a frequently asked questions section at the end summary what can you do with it read a book it can store s of books take an entire library away with you on holiday buy a book you can browse the amazon kindly store and buy books over a wifi connection borrow a book using the kindly owners library you can borrow one of books if you have amazon prime membership share your books using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family highlight a section using the touch screen you can highlight a particular interesting few lines if several people highlight the same section that s also indicated record a bookmark to come back to it later read a book on your kindly continue on your smartphone or tablet computer and it will jump to your last known position look up a word and record them in the vocabulary builder track a characters appearance throughout a book using the x ray feature read for weeks without needing to recharge typically weeks share you books multiple singles on the same account or family sharing access every book you ve ever owned on the cloud available for download within seconds over wifi or g what devices are available as of july amazon have the following kindly devices on sale kindly around cdn kindly paperwhite th generation dpi launched october around cdn new kindly paperwhite th gen dpi launched july around cdn kindly voyager around us doesnt seem to be on sale in amazon canada kindly fire or colour tablet computers at around cdn so you re faced with a few devices plus additional options which to buy here s a quick summary in order of cost the entry level kindly an entry level black and white e ink book reader it has a inch touch screen with enough storage to hold thousands of books and a battery which should last around weeks a terrific device to read books and a worthy contender for the technically minded it has a gh processor and gb of memory with an e ink display essentially this means it s a black and white b fantastic to read even in bright sunlight c requires very little power hence the battery lasts for weeks instead of hours new kindly paperwhite launched in this is really an upgrade adding a super sharp display with pixels per inch the same as the top of the range voyage the high resolution screen does provide a crisp text which is pleasing to the eye but battery life is reduced from weeks of the original paperwhite to weeks but still a very long time compared to the existing paperwhite it also includes double the memory which means its faster and sticker than before and a new booker font plus better presentation of fonts on screen if you have an existing paperwhite its probably not worth upgrading however if you own a prior device you notice the huge leap in screen quality contrast and performance the voyage far more expensive that paperwhite this is thinner and g lighter it has more of a quality feel with the screen flush with the e reader body which makes it look more like a tablet and keeps dirt from getting caught in the edges the back has a soft touch plastic finish which feels lovely in the hand and it has new page press buttons on the side to turn the pages when the buttons are pressed theres a gentle vibration for feedback nice touch it has gb of storage same as the paperwhite and a similar battery which should last around weeks on a single charge although it has the same sharp dpi screen as the paperwhite the backlight includes an ambient light sensor so it automatically adjusts to different lighting conditions this means if you read it the dark it will automatically adjust the brightness so it doesnt look too bright in addition you find when you switch off the room light your eyes naturally become accustomed to the darkness to compensate the voyage automatically soften the light slightly a lovely example of attention to detail in this premium device kindly fire tablet computer the kindly fire range is a very different beast to the rest of the kindly range similar to the apple ipad mini it has a high resolution screen a fast processor and lots of memory with a colour screen and a much shorter battery life hours rather than weeks although you can read books on a fire using the amazon kindly app you find the kindly with its sharp black and white screen far more like reading a physical book you find it produces less eye strain and whereas a tablet computer is better suited to surfing the web watching videos and reading emails the kindly is a dedicated book reader device unlike a kindly the fire produces light at the blue end of the spectrum which means it may make it harder for you to sleep the paperwhite and voyage also ave the advantage of a soft white back light which is far more suited to reading in bed and it wont for example wake your partner if reading in the dark finally unlike the rest of the kindly range the fire is almost useless in bright sunlight so while its fine for everyday use its less useful on holiday the kindly range of devices are perfect to take away on holiday as they can carry thousands of books and are a pleasure to read even in bright sunlight what other options do i have having decided upon the model kindly paperwhite voyage or fire the next decision is around special offers ie adverts g or wifi connectionpersonally i have no issue with adverts on a kindly they only appear on screen when the screen save is on and are not at all distracting the g option is a more difficult question this effectively means you can use your kindly to buy or download books over the air instead of at home or near a wifi hotspot personally i went for the wifi model as the saving is considerable but its a personal choice of course if you wont have wifi at home then you need the g option one point worth mentioning however is if you have a modern smartphone you can always create a personal hotspot or local wifi signal that your kindly or indeed any other wifi device can connect to got to settings personal hotspot on your mobile to set one up and you can connect your wifi only kindly while youre out and about conclusion if you love books but your on a budget the original kindly with wifi and special offers is a great option you still be able to carry thousands of book around with you but you lose out on the soft white back light and super crisp display of the papwerwhite the kindly paperwhite is your next best option and is a terrific device for reading with a superb dpi super sharp screen finally theres the top of the range voyage with the page press buttons and ambient light sensor which automatically adjusts the brightness if youre in the market for a tablet computer then the kindly fire range is worth considering but you get a better book reading experience on the kindly myself i have both a paperwhite and an ipad air i was skeptical at first but the kindly is a perfect device for reading with one hand on the train and the back light and long battery life a huge bonus frequently asked questions q what file format will a kindly read kindly format aw kindly aw txt pdf unprotected mob prc natively in addition to html doc doc jpeg gif png amp through conversion what it doesnt support pub format no but you can convert your pub books using a freely available program called calibre simple search for you tube um tear zw and you see a video explaining how to do this simple q if i lose my kindly do i lose my books as well no all books are available on your amazon account to download on a new device q can i save my place in the book yes it will automatically save your place and if you resume on other device it will prompt you to jump to that position q i often need reading glasses can i adjust the font size yes theres a range of fonts and sizes to suit all tastes can i share books with my partner or children yes you can now share your books using amazon family library to link two amazon accounts and four children and share your books with the entire family can i use a kindly to read in beta yes but only on the paperwhite and voyage models its a pleasure to read in the dark with a soft white light for the base kindly model you need the light on are there any free books available yes over classic titles are available for free out of copyright and they can be legally downloaded if you have a amazon prime membership you can also borrow a book from the kindly owners library which includes around books q how long does the battery last depending upon model you should get between and weeks between charges on around minutes of reading per day ive certainly found ive gone for weeks without charging the device how long does it take to charge from absolutely flat around hours how many books will the kindly hold literally thousands you can also download every book youve ever owned from your amazon account so the list is quite literally unlimited q do i need anything else you need a smartphone charger or laptop with a usb socket as the kindly range doesnt come with a charger but the fire does amazon also offer an additional charger to buy if you need it some people also buy a cover but i think this is not really needed it adds to the weight and is not really needed it will protect your kindly from a drop however and protect the screen if its left knocking around in a bag\",\"works great with one critical flaw significantly improved read more\",\"because i like it but feel it s overpriced according to the info the paperwhite charges faster with the charger made for a kindly but i think any brand will work it came in a package deal when i bought my paperwhite otherwise i would ve skipped it used what i ve been using for my old kindly i gave it stars because i like it but feel it s overpriced\",\"quite the steal this is quite the steal as already pointed out the total value is at the price this is a great deal i was able to use the recent prime off offer to get this for i bought this to have a kindly to keep in my bag my regular kindly is the voyage but i ve owned several other singles k to oasis i compared the two screens with the same setup and the only thing i noticed is that the curve of the letters is sharper on the voyage but that was expected does it have a frontlight no but as long as you know what to expect you shouldn t be surprised no light no buttons but it also isn t advertised to have those features\",\"a superb e ink reader but is it worth the money okay if you don t want to read my whole review i ll summarize it right here the oasis is the most technologically advanced e ink reader that amazon or anyone else for that matter has produced to date but is it worth for the least expensive version wi fi only with ads in my opinion the answer is no not when the very capable paperwhite is available for at the time i m writing this but i m sure that there is a market for the oasis probably for the techno geeks and gadgeteers like myself who love trying new products like the oasis and serious readers who want the absolute best possible experience in reading but for the typical reader i just don t think the oasis adds enough to the reading experience to be worth the high price especially for those who already have a paperwhite or voyage for reference here s a brief comparison of the oasis with the paperwhite and the voyage oasis size x

novels in good light people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no the kindly is my first e ink reader i own an ipad an iphone and have owned a windows based phone in the past that i used as an reader my overall impression of the device is good the good i d honestly rather read linear read from page one to the end one page at a time fiction from it than a book because i can t always get comfortable with a book hardcover are sometimes a bit heavy and paperback don t always lie open easily the kindly is incredibly light and thin i can hold it in one hand easily the page turn buttons are conveniently located page turns aren t instant but they re probably quicker than turning a physical page in a printed book there are just a lot more page turns unless you choose a small font the contrast is better than other readers i ve seen there is zero eye strain in good light my eyesight isn t the greatest and i like being able to increase the font size and read without glasses i love being able to browse the kindly store and read samples before deciding to purchase the experimental browser is surprisingly usable but isn t great it is useful for browsing wikipedia and blogs the biggest drawback to the browser is the awkward pointer navigation using the way pad it sync your furthest read page over the internet so you can pick up where you left off using your iphone or ipad the so so the kindly store could use more categories and sorting options you can t sort by top rated and there is no category for alternate histories for example finding a very specific type of fiction relies on keyword searches which don t do a great job the wifi sometimes doesn t connect before it times out read more\",\"new kindly buyer thinking about book read on people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i got my first kindly this is a nice ebook reader i m going to jump right in and tell you what i found to be its pros and cons then i m going to tell how it compares to its biggest competitor the barnes noble book simple touch kindly s pros great screen many people do not find lcdb hard to read on e g smartphones tablets kindly fire book color etc but virtually everyone will find e ink easier to read any time of day especially the newest e ink pearl displays they simply look like paper and ink i have never experienced any eye strain reading e ink book readers but i have with lcd based phone tablet screens thin and lightweight this kindly is thinner than any paperback and lighter too this makes it very easy to hold in a sitting position and for long periods too it also makes it easy to transport in a purse backpack or messenger bag or in luggage for traveling many people like to take a few books when travelling and this kindly lets you take as many as you want and adds virtually nothing to your travel burden good value even without a touchscreen the kindly is a good value it is a well made product it offers cloud storage of your books and well it should since it offers no ability to expand storage capacity with an add in micro card the screen is excellent amazon is a dogged competitor in book pricing the kindly is the best value of amazon s e ink readers some may be tempted to get the version with the built in light if you can afford it sure go ahead but let me point out you don t have to spend for a fancy schmancy book light your local dollar store has them for wait for it a buck read

it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to last year s fire dx but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire setup took a while despite being a brand new product the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs screen display video playback this version of the fire has the best screen display of any previous model of fire and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp in a side by side comparison to last years dx version and my ipad air yes the kindly guy uses an ipad for work i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship read more\",\"updated incredible value for under updated after spending quite a bit more time with the device i would give it a due to a few specific gaps that are a bit annoying however you are still getting an amazing tablet with front and rear facing cameras a gorgeous interface fairly happy performance and durability all for under bucks i cant imagine not buying these for myself and my whole family but not a primary tablet for a tech adult by any means for background i have every kindly a couple fires and multiple tablets from apple microsoft and samsung note that my review with stars considers the value equation not just performance and how that may or may not compare to other tablets if you are expecting this to compare to a tablet costing several times more don t bother but if you are looking for a great entry level tablet that does most of the things people want this little tablet definitely delivers the value pricing config i prefer this tablet with ads and no accessories to keep the costs down you have the option to spend more money but i recommend against it you can easily see the specs online so i wont do you the discourses of simply cutting and pasting those here here is the price breakdown base price what an incredible price point or buy and get a sixth one free this puts it into reach of schools and non profits no sponsored screensaver big deal that each time you turn it on it shows you something interesting you might want micro card for gb you probably already have one laying around somewhere beyond that there is memory in the device and you are using the cloud for storage mostly anyway if you end up needing this just buy one off amazon it certainly wont be more expensive read more\",\"amazon fire is a great choice the product is user friendly easy to hook up and a great deal for the price i would recommend you give it a chance easy to compare to the competitor s product\",\"great tablet for basic use this is my first kindly since the st generation that tablet went away after a couple years kindly fire th gen is a great tablet for the money honestly i don t use it for reading i use it for browsing websites social media and listen to podcasts i use my bluetooth headphones to listen to the podcasts the couple times i ve used the speaker on the tablet i haven t been disappointed but i wasn t impressed it works just fine for watching videos in bed had no problems hearing search google for some tips and tricks to get apps from the google play store silk browser is terrible i recommend installing opera i recommend this tablet for people like me who want to just lay in bed or on the couch and doing simple tasks on the tablet don t need a or tablet to do what i m doing\",\"i ve had the kindly fire dx inch tablet for i ve had the kindly fire dx inch tablet for almost years and when i compare it to the fire hd the earlier tablet comes out the big winner i find the larger tablet considerably slower several apps load quite slowly the battery is consumed much more quickly maybe this is not comparing apples with apples but i had expected at least the same speed\",\"nice tablet with sharp display to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues screen display video playback this version of the fire has the absolute best screen display of any fire model to date looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching with my standard test of the fire devices over the past couple of years don t laugh the first episode of the wonder woman tv series from the s the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model as well as this year s model of the fire hd for you technical folks out there the display is x with more pixels per inch than the fire hd wi fi connectivity the initial wi fi setup took some time as it wouldn t remember the password for my router after each software update crash reboot series after the final operating software update i mentioned above however it was fairly easy to connect to the internet via wi fi my standard test for trying out new gadgets is to see how fast they run side by side with a known piece of equipment doing the same test at the best place of wi fi in my house and the worst place where it drags in this comparison i had this dx version of the fire sitting next to last year s and this year s version of the hd fire as well as last year s hd fire motorola rarr smartphone my ipad yes the kindly guy uses an ipad for work and the first generation fire the model from two years ago all just using a wi fi connection vs cellular connectivity my normal website test is to hit the mobile websites of foxnews cnn my personalized yahoo page google and the houston chronicle the ones that were usually slow on the other devices were faster on the dx houston chronicle and cnn and for the other sites i couldn t tell a difference in speed at the location closest to my router when i went to the slowest worst reception location of my house the speed did have a noticeable difference in the other devices as this one was a little bit faster than all but last year s model of the kindly fire hd yes it was also faster than this year s model of the fire hd but i attribute the increase in speed to the dual antennas on the dx sound music playback the two speakers are located in the back of the kindly fire in two not noticeable ports one on the top and one on the bottom my test of this feature was ranking up van haven s panama to maximum volume i always want to see if it could really play the guitar links and i would alternate covering one speaker up over the other you have true stereo sound with no degradation of the sound that makes you think you are about to blow the speaker the dolly speakers sound nice and you do get to hear the bass however i am still of the opinion the speakers aren t going to do very well being placed in the back as i am in the front i want to be able to hear whatever i am listening to without really having to crank it up and disturbing someone else in the room that s what happens when you start losing your hearing like i am while the cover for this version has not shipped yet why aren t the covers released at the same time i imagine the sound quality might decrease with a cover in the back over the speakers the x ray feature is pretty neat as it displays the lyrics on the screen if you are so inclined if you are not it is as simple as the tap of an icon to make the lyric feature go away email setup consistent with previous versions of the fire email setup was very easy for my main gmail account both with the software came with the fire but my primary use of an existing app called enhanced email i purchased here in the amazon app store i did setup the email app that came with the program with no problem it took about a minute to setup my main google account and i was able to send and receive emails as well as synth my online calendar via google s calendar and contacts for those of you asking yourself why am i using the enhanced email program the simple answer is like many of you i have more than one email account you can quickly switch back and forth on the accounts with the tool the lazy person in me appreciates that as i don t like getting out of the lazy chair once i m settled in new tabs and screen layout in addition to the normal tabs amazon has continued to make tweaks with the look and feel to the overall display such as more things to scroll through to find what you are looking for in an easier manner interesting and consistent with my experiences with this year s model of the fire hd i purchased the one with special offers and the only ad i have seen so far is on the main screen save vs being overwhelmed with ads like last year s model reading books turning pages is pretty darn easy just tap the side of the screen to go to the next page or back a page or you can swine your finger across the screen to do the same amazon did add the feature to see the book s description for books on your device like they have with the e ink kindly always an annoyance with last year s model which is a plus as i can t remember what each book in my digital to be read pile is about getting to the book description requires several taps on the screen to eventually get to where you want to be if there is an easier way to do it i can t find it and maybe i should be one of the first guys ever to crack open the electronic user s manual to figure it out doubt it for those of you who have wondered you still can t organize your books into categories unless you purchase a third party app a here in the amazon app store bluetooththere is a bluetooth connection and i did my usual test of this feature by taking it out to my car and having the fire stream music through my car stereo there were no delays or skips with the connection and it paired up in about a minute just make sure you give it a device name so you can recognize it and be recognized camera there is a camera on this model it faces the front or toward the user reader focusing and taking a picture is pretty easy and amazon will by default store your pictures in the cloud which counts against your storage allotment i d recommend turning that automatic storage feature off unless you are sure you want it because if you go over the limit that will provide amazon another opportunity to collect a monthly revenue stream from you charger unlike previous models of the fire this one does include a charger if you re scratching your head with that comment in previous models you had to purchase a charger separately for which always seemed kind of silly for amazon to do monday button a new feature with this model and not included on this year s regular model of the fire is the introduction of the monday button basically you can touch the button and a video screen will pop up and you can actually see and talk to a live customer service agent i haven t pressed the button yet to try it out as i think i would feel pretty dumb when they ask me how can they help i don t want to say i just wanted to see if this works and just stopped by to say hi for purposes of this review what i wish it had a case that was ready to go and shipped when the fire was ready why are we waiting a case is very important in order to protect your investment also i m interested to see how they try to not hurt the speaker s performance i mentioned above due to the speakers being in the back of the unit and hopefully not covered up with a case overall at for the gb of memory model for gb of memory i think this is a good deal for someone who really uses the video apps feature kids will love it as they can read books play games watch tv and movies and a whole lot of other things adults should like it for the exact same reasons but while i try to minimize the amount of work related stuff i do at home with the business apps that are available here in the amazon app store and other places around the internet i can also work on excel and word compatible files when i have to without having to fire up my work laptop or whatever the case may be if you ve never owned a tablet before or are looking to upgrade from an earlier model fire i would recommend this one if video and apps are your thing but make sure you purchase the higher memory one vs the minimum gb if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine or looking for a tablet for your younger children i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of last year s model or get this year s model of the kindly fire hd at read more\",\"a great upgrade for me from an older kindly fire i purchased the original kindly fire in and the second generation kindly fire in i gave my original one to my grandson and he is still using it for apps and reading i liked both of them and i have to tell you that they have held up very well one is over years old and the other is years old and i have not had any issues with them since i have not upgraded in years i thought i would get a new one with a larger memory and a faster cpu and a higher resolution display there are many improvements beyond even those features i have to tell you that overall i am impressed with this new one i didn t feel the need to purchase a kindly fire every year and when i purchased the next one i wanted it to be a definite upgrade step to what i had i stayed with the inch size as i like to portability and weight for long term reading i alternate between the kindly paperwhite for reading in the daytime and at night sometimes and i use the kindly fire for reading in the evening and at night plus browsing the internet and getting email this new kindly fire hd version is very fast and easy to use setting it up for the internet and downloading my apps and books was a breeze i like the fact that the larger memory allows me to carry more apps and books the higher resolution of the screen is helpful in reading books as the text is clearer and easier on my eyes than the older kindly fires we own the screen is better for playing apps and watching videos and movies and it is worth the upgrade from the older kindly fires i like that this version has both a front and rear facing camera i use the camera a lot on all of my tablets and i own many apple pads apple iphone and android tablets read more\",\"simply put great value great tablet let me make things simple for everyone this is a great tablet and a beautiful device it has everything of tablet users need and want the that are power users can pay up for an ipad amazon prime is a must if you have one of these tablets and if you already have amazon prime it is a no brainer to buy this tablet if you are looking for an entertainment device that also gives you the ability to check email and surf the web as needed people complain that one app here or there is missing if you want the tried and true the basics then you have nothing to worry about of course there is a weather app of course there is a nyt app all the normal stuff is there sure a particular game or more specialized app may not be available but anything most people actually want need is going to be there this is not a device for the office if you want to review spreadsheets then clearly do not buy it that goes without saying as for the actual device it feels well put together the plastic back actually felt closer to metal to me it has a solid feel the screen is beautiful and has plenty of resolution for watching movies surfing the web etc it is also sufficient for reading though the kindly paperwhite admittedly has clearer print so if you only plan to read on this device then get the paperwhite also i find the word runner feature to be quite intriguing in fact i think we all may read using this method in a few years before buying the device i read that load times are slow and switching between apps is trouble what i have found is that it may take a second for your movie or app to load but we are talking a second or two max if you can t wait two seconds for something then i don t know what to say read more\",\"nice tablet with sharp display to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are

through the reviews and read some pretty ridiculous reasons to not give this tablet five stars one such was that the tablet weighed a whole oz more and that resulted in a star review let me start off by saying if that is the reason for giving a crap review that is ridiculous it says the tablet weight depends on the manufacturing the other funny one is that someone is upset with the special offers on the front screen that s why you get a cheap and good tablet it even says in the description that there will be ads on the lock screen it takes a second to swine up and unlock the screen so the bad reviews are just reviews by people looking to nit pick this tablet is exactly what amazon was describing it is cheap looks good loads apps quickly expandable storage good speakers decent screen and all while staying under bucks the start up didn t take long and it came reloaded with my account on it for dollars this is a good buy and the complaints on the weight and the ads are ridiculous reasons to give this tablet a hobby review buy this tablet if you want a cheap e reader that can also sure the web watch movies and shows check facebook or twitter or read books on ignore the negative reviews and you won t be disappointed\",\"you get what you pay for i ve been an ipad user since the original came out i also have an ipad i have worked in it for the past few years so i would say i am pretty good with technology and fancy new devices with that introduction out of the way i will be reviewing key points that i have seen touched upon in other reviews here goes buildthe device feels nice and solid i m a little surprised at how heavy it is but that s not necessarily a bad thing the rubberized backing is always nice for added grip it s not as nice as say nobody aluminum but it s not either screenthe screen is fantastic but my problem is the same as when ipad got retina display other than the os most apps look rather pixelated a lot of the games i tried are not high definition at least not high enough to look smooth on this screen hopefully apps get updated to higher resolutions lock screen adsyeah there are ads on my lock screen i m not sure why this is such a big deal how much time do people really spend looking at the lock screen the first thing i thought when i saw the ads is wow the pictures are really crisp the ads are there to subsidized some of the price tag i might pay the to get rid of them so i can customize it but i might not i feel like this has been blown out of proportion by other customers soundthe sound from the speakers is great much better than you would get from more expensive devices very crisp and clean i have the official amazon case on and it has not affected the sound at all nothing much else to say i doubt anyone will complain about this crashing ve had two apps crash on opening i don t know if it is the app or the os it s probably somewhere in the middle again not a big deal for me read more\",\"excellent rd generation tablet

the perfect color accuracy on kindly fire dx at the lowest possible battery consumption and device weight we used blue not white led blue led allow for a much more accurate and rich representation of color and result in an up to improvement in power efficiency as a result of using these blue led you may notice a very narrow faint blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background such as books or web pages all displays have some level of light emission around the edges and the light on the kindly fire dx is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy if this is something that you think would bother you i d recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the dx at a local best buy or office superstar i ve also

differs from the old version as follows best new feature the price has been reduced the gb version of the old device cost with special offers ads the new gb version costs and you can get a hb version for more secretly removed amazon has removed the ability to mirror your display on miracast devices such as tvs now that feature is now only available on generation and fires including last years hd however you can still cast prime videos to a first or fire stick what comes in the box the hd fire a short foot usb cord and a power adapter so you can charge and use the device right out of the box size the new hd is a fraction thicker than the hd leather cases for the old hd will fit the new hd but hard shell cases will not however the auto wake feature of some older cases won t work one complaint i had about the earlier versions was that the back was very slick and slippery to hold without a case read more\",\"amazon s two bargain fire tablets how good is the model and how do they compare and note sound quality limitations amazon has just updated their bargain priced fire tablets while these latest models are only slightly better than the preceding generation i believe that they still represent the absolute best value tablet on the market its still hard for me to adjust to the fact that a tablet device can now be purchased for just fifty bucks and its such a good all around performer for the most part i purchased both the and fire models because i wanted to see how they compared and i was curious how they performed they are both shown in the video attached to this review i will focus here on the model to try to help the potential buyer decide whether or not the more expensive fire tablet is worth the extra money and if the model is worth purchasing on its own merits i ve given this model a star rating after further consideration and largely because of the very mediocre quality sound output see detailed comments below it is still a terrific bargain at the price but i do want to be clear that it is not ideal for all uses summary these new models represent minimal changes compared to the previous generation fire tablets same display specs as before amazon says the model has an improved display same processors gh quad core but a newer model that is probably slightly faster in operation same standard and available storage or gb or gb new colors the model is cheaper the model now has dual band wi fi previously single band wi fi for better connectivity kids edition now available for both models previously only the model read more\",\"first kindly going on about two weeks now love it didn t think i d like it but i was so wrong so easy to use for a first time tablet user like me\",\"dead after months after months my tablet is no longer usable it is stuck on the boot screen i invested a lot of into amazon movies and books this sticks\",\"i had low expectations but i was pleasant surprised i had low expectations but i was pleasant surprised but keep in mind that this is not an ipad or typical android tablet this is an amazon media and shopping machine it is well built has good battery life reasonably fast and responsive dual band wifi sd card slot decent display and so so camera no tablet is going to give you awesome sound but i was surprised at how well the two speakers sound on this tablet no tablet it going to give you a great camera and this tablet is probably on the lower end of the spectrum it works but it won t be your go to camera for important shots this tablet excels at playing amazon content music and video it is a great reader although a little heavy compared to a kindly device it makes shopping easy perhaps too easy the os is based on android but don t look for google play or google apps in general this is nothing like an android tablet finally you can t beat the price i think amazon wants to get these in the hands of as many people as possible i would have given this stars if that option was available i didn t give it stars only because it is not a general purpose tablet this is a dramatic improvement over the fire the integration of alexa is flawless and works very well depends on whether or not you have an echo and on how you feel about that product i have an echo and find it useful not essential but useful i find myself using alexa on this tablet more than i thought i would\",\"unreal performance for i couldn t be happier i ll preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting a tablet to perform at anywhere near that level i have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured i d give the kindly fire hd a try i chose the base gb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access what i ve found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and lang speeds mentioned in the early reviews in fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the year s best purchase first off the look is nice it s sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than i d imagined it s not heavy enough to be considered a negative the display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate response to the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasant surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to input for those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide you i first checked out the e reader function my books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the reader read more\",\"nice tablet with sharp display to sum up what i will tell you about in the details below for you are getting a good deal on a tablet computer especially if you compare it to the for last year s first generation fire hd and the or more you can spend on a wi fi version of the ipad overall if you consider the price and the functionality i think this is a great tool toy if you watch a lot of video or play a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and the new hd fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual reboot consistent with the fire hd it crashed during setup playing a song watching a tv show and reading a book it took a little over an hour to get this thing up and running without consistent crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more\",\"kindly fire hd i purchased the original kindly fire on release day last year it served me pretty well but was extremely glitch it would freeze restart and shutter while playing games for what it was an entry level device it wasnt bad so when the kindly fire hd was released i decided i might as well give it a go as well so far the kindly hd looks to be twice the machine the original was i am gon na keep this short and sweet and just create a pros and cons list for you guys i dont want to be too long winded but if you have questions you post in the comments i will try to respond to them for a little while today pros vibrant screen much more responsive to the touch than the original kindly ever was games that shuttered on the original play flawless on the hd the speakers are awesome loud clear and crisp no need for the volume app like on the original fire the device is slim sleek and sexy really like the curves on the back and the styling front facing camera works great for style quality was better than that on my iii phone wifi seems a bit faster but not by much silk still isnt an optimal browser though i have maps download and maps upload subscribed service cloud sync worked like a charm almost everything from my old fire is now on my new fire hd the device feels sturdy and well built cons the customers also bought on the bottom of the home screen is terrible i can care less about what others bought the advertisements on the lock screen are fine and understandable they really dont bother me at all or with the function of the device read more\",\"a great upgrade from the fire a great buy at this price first off i appreciate you reading this review just so you get a little background on me we are major tech users we have multiple tablets from apple samsung and asks this fire tablet is comparable in a different way this tablet uses a amazon based operating system fire os so no play store or itunes as a prime member however this tablet is an incredible value because you get instant access to all of your prime benefits ive had a chance to really put this product thru its paces over the past days i ordered of these tablets so me and my wife could really put these to use we have gone thru full power cycles fully charging and fully draining the battery thru use it does get hours of hefty use so battery life is a plus this tablet is a keeper screen looks fantastic colors seem to be just slightly dull however the resolution for everyday use is perfect for this price point speed is happy enough for basic use and handles more complex tasks and games without much issue on a passmark benchmark test i got a score of however the second hd constantly grades about points lower so it is a possibility that even tho you have the same exact tablet they might be built slightly different so performance will vary at this price point i didnt expect them to come out exactly the same this tablet is basically the same specs as the samsung tab a at half the price oh and the hd actually offers a slightly better resolution then the samsung minus one star for the wifi connection i have lost connection several times on both tablets seems to only happen on my g connection also the screen being so reflective it is impossible to use at all outdoors also sadly is a fingerprint magnet read more\",\"excellent rd generation tablet that compares favorably to the competition of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this is the middle model

operating system and new features a redesigned shell with the power and volume control buttons more readily accessible an absolutely amazing display superb sound an included power adapter and the new monday feature update some users are reporting a bluish glow around the edges of the screen for the dx if you search on youtube for dx blue haze you can find a video showing the issue amazon has

blue tint around the edge of the device when looking at items with a white background such as books or web pages all displays have some level of light emission around the edges and the light on the kindly fire dx is blue due to the technology used to render perfect color accuracy if this is something that you think would bother you i d recommend taking a look at the youtube video or taking a look at the dx at a local best buy or office superstar i ve also uploaded a user image here of my dx with a book loaded so that you can see the blue glow http www amazon com gp customer media product

functionality of the reader read more\",\"slowest fire sold i ve owned several different tablets this one is by far the slowest and i don t mean it s a little slower i mean you have to wait up to minutes sometimes for the apps to load onto the screen opening apps can be quick or take up to minutes i ve had far more issues with this fire than any of the others we ve owned if i had realized the difference in speed i would have kept my old one it s definitely not work the larger screen it s a crap shoot on a daily basis on how fast it will be but even on it s fastest day it s significantly slower than the others\",\"excellent tablet at a reasonable price the fire dx is setting the bar for other tablets the new fire dx is definitely one powerful tablet packed with some pretty nice features while it does have some small flaws here and there it generally is an all around great buy i ll go over some of what i ve noticed using the tablet what i ve learned from others who are using it as well as the specs and how i feel about them hopefully it ll give you more insight into the product and help you make an easier decision whether or not to buy it build quality one of the first things i noticed was the outstanding build quality the tablet weighs less than much of its competition and provides a nice feel due to the materials used in making the case which gives you a nice grip so you don t drop the tablet as easily everything feels solid it doesn t have that cheap feel that some of the android based tablets have apple still holds the title for most durable case as it s aluminum but unless you plan on throwing this thing around you don t need the aluminum it weighs more and it s cold snapdragon processor and gpu this new dx comes with the gh snapdragon processor and a nice gpu so this is going to be one of your fastest tablets on the market at the moment if not the fastest intel and india are continuously working on cpu s for the tablet and chromebook markets bragging about their performance and how they blow away the competition acre for example is utilizing an india terra k arm based cpu running at gh quad core that is instantly fast for something like a chromebook which functionality wise is pretty much the same thing as a tablet unfortunately for acre the snapdragon cpu on the fire dx is more powerful gh vs gh and appears to be using less power read

that i am tough on amazon when it comes to their own items it needs to deliver quality for the price point to earn stars from me please take the time to read my entire review and feel free to ask questions i will do my best to respond to them as i can and update the review to reflect those answers and other things i discover along the way first my background i own many amazon singles bw fire gen fire gen as well as apple ipad gen samsung note and have an lg g smartphone had a samsung s before that notebooks chromebooks etc i have also used many other products including the fire dx line i have a solid computer background as well but honestly i am more of a casual user when it comes to tablets like this one amazon has changed many things over the life of the fire product line adding and removing features like cameras the first generation had one but the second generation removed them but not they are back they are all useful devices but each one has its own niche so to speak so make sure whatever you get has the features that are important to you now to this model this is like a big smartphone which is a big difference from past singles it is more compact lighter and yet still very usable in fact for me the shrinking of size increases the usefulness i find that i use my smartphone way more than my tablets even the smaller fire hd and samsung note tablets so i am expecting this to replace more of that on the couch usage which is great since it so much less expensive than most smartphones that means you can feel less bad about scratches that might occur or the accidental drops i am guilty of both read more\",\"i am delighted and should get several years out of this big tablet esp w screen mirror now google play is on it what a deal i got this great tablet for a great price on prime day but was a little concerned it would be too big to handle but i was wrong first i i was very surprised by several things about the fire that made me smile even though it is large in size the weight is light so it is much easier to handle than expected esp since my fire hd heavy unit it does several things i wasn t expecting one is it has screen mirroring that means you can see your tablets screen on you great big tv screen if you choose for games or what ever smooth and fast due to the nice processor who hoo google play store can be easily added without disrupting you amazon experience look it up on youtube it took less than minutes and it was up and running i think the screen is beautiful can not imagine what others are seeing but this screen looks great to me finally they put the speakers in the front so it is much easier to hear you shows or music etc i think this is my far i put in a great big g sd card and i am loaded to download anything i choose loads of movie from the a amazon prime movies all of my audio books from audible and a huge amt of my kindly books i am delighted and should get several years out of this tablet in its present format esp now that google play store is on it happy happy happy\",\"the single best value fire in the entire line skip the fire and get the fire instead if you read my fire tv review you know that i am tough on

device to transfer any data to it you must restart reply the device for each file even a thumb drive can do more without an interface\",\"great value for the price i m pleased so happy with my new fire and i wish i had bought more some of the pros of this tablet are it has alexa memory expansion slot and a nice size at inches it is the perfect size to take on the go and ebook it is a little thicker than some of the more expensive tablets on the market but because of this it seems more durable especially for kids the apps and games seem to run smoothly and the colors are good on screen i install the google play store and connect to the google play store to download apps is easy like youtube without the google play store you will stuck with the amazon store and apps i often use the tablet to watch videos with my meldung e bluetooth headphones meldung e anc bluetooth headphones active noise cancelling headphones wireless stereo headphones with microphone economic design for kids adult black this is a excellent headphones with noise cancelling at an affordable price if you are looking for this is right for you and it has two colors for choice black and rosegold i have bought two i did some research and found that the meldung company is an audio electronics innovator specializing in bluetooth anc headphones vibration speakers wifi speakers no wonder their headphones sound really nice also recommend back to here the only cons i would say about that the tablet has two camera rear is mp and front is mp very very basic having two speakers but the speaker is not great overall it is a good value for the price this tablet can do whatever other tablets those cost twice or triple the price do\",\"an enlarged version of the dx same good internal components with a nicer

tablet would be slow and the display would be less than impressive i was wrong what a bargain this little beauty is this model cost but it comes with ad s displayed on the lock screen when your tablet is dormant once your screen times out they disappear you can pay up front to get an ad free version so i assumed to unlock the tablet i d have to spend to seconds looking at an ad for amazon prime or a product from the daily specials section of amazon com i abstained from paying for ad removal and was pleasant surprised to find that the ads are only on the lock screen and that as soon as i unlock the tablet they disappear immediately here are my pros and cons thus far pro perfect size for ebooks and web surfing to alleviate strain on the eyes from my phone displaynice sturdy casing that gives it a nice left but still weighs in as one of the lighter tablets on the marketchild accounts amazon allows you to set up this tablet with age restricted access for kids making this a low cost piece of tech that is perfect for school kids and allows mom and dad to ration the amount of time lil johnny can play clash of clans and how much he can hit the ol visa card for battery life thus far wife was

helpful was this review helpful to you yes no first off i would like to say this tablet is a great deal for just i tried finding a tablet for under that would just work properly and to let you know it s impossible secondly i want to tell you how i decided to buy this tablet i first bought the inch dragon touch tablet for but to be blunt it sucked it was so slow that the web browser would always freeze even if i did a simple google search i did not want to take a chance with it anymore and returned it after days of using it then i decided to give the kindly fire hd a chance exterior the exterior is well built no loose pieces and the plastic is very firm my previous cheap tablet had plastic that felt it was going to snap if you held it too hard of course the ipad mini has a glass screen and aluminum body but it also starts at there are ports a micro usb and a headphones jack to plug in your headphones the nice thing is that the micro usb is universal and finding a plug is cheap and easy to find although amazon does include a very nice and not cheaply made cable wall charger along with your kindly the previous kindly did not include them and they are worth the buttons for the volume and power are a nice touch i would not be surprised if new generation tablets will include these style buttons only down side is there is no port for an sd card so you can store more memory it would be a nice feature but if you really need all that storage go buy a computer display one word amazing maybe i am pushing it but the screen is so clear i own an iphone and my eyes prefer

are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend the regular kindly fire hd that is only if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire dx to the original fire hd as well as this year s model of the fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of this year s model of the kindly fire hd setup took a long time despite being a brand new product the fire dx attempted to download and install several operating software updates software updates on a kindly are usually in the background and it was annoying watching the crashes and manual

crashes but after the final software update it has worked as expected without further issues read more\",\"fire in colors one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i m loving my new fire i was looking for another fire and since it was not available and this is only a little larger comes in great colors and has alexa i was hooked and couldn t wait for it to

offline and it offered exactly that but fell short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet larger screen than the fire and the ability to watch content offline this is a decent device to get however if you already have an earlier kindly like the dx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device if you re looking for a very basic tablet to watch videos or for your kids the fire is a better option quick summary pros price dual stereo speakers expandable memory slot great for viewing content offline full access to amazon content good basic tablet specially for watching videos cons screen resolution crisp but not great tags quite a bit when switching or starting closing apps runs fine once an app is open battery life is just ok freezes quite often and the only solution is to reboot the device which becomes frustrating after a while the device is basically slow to load apps tags quite a bit when switching apps this becomes worse as you load more content on the device freezes quite often and i find myself having to reboot it every now and then a frustrating experience to say the least the device is claimed to be designed for entertainment true but i would also add not designed for performance this is meant to be a basic value tablet giving you access to the amazon ecosystem and it is exactly that read more\",\"the single best value fire in the entire line skip

because it is longer it seem top heavy to me the back is also slick and slippery to hold mine has a habit of sliding off the table display the resolution of the screen is x same as the hd but the pixel density is lower due to the longer screen length in practical use though you can t tell the difference the display is nice and bright but barely readable in bright sunlight one nice touch is

a lot of games on your device the video quality is outstanding and you can really tell a difference between this and last year s fire if you are a first time tablet buyer where price vs value is a key consideration or if you are looking for an affordable tablet for the kids i d recommend this regular fire hd vs a more expensive version if you re comparing last year s hd model to this version and it is operating fine i d say save your money and continue to get your money s worth out of that one my review below compares a lot of the features of this version of the fire to last year s fire hd but also some of the features for a first time user consistent with my experience with setup of previous models of the fire setup took a while despite being a brand new product the fire attempted to download and install several operating software updates you just need to be patient while it downloads and installs screen display video playback this version of the fire has a great screen display and looking at the technical specs amazon made some major changes in the display resolution and the picture appears more crisp i compared the viewing experience watching an episode of the lost ship the display on this fire was one heck of a lot better in terms of sharpness than last year s model read more\",\"amazon did it right this time really enjoying my tablet updates th update has some tips i am thrilled with the new fire hd even before it gets alexa at that time i will likely be ecstatic i am far from a tablet novice i had the original fire the fire the samsung galaxy tab and the galaxy tab s my phones have always been samsung flagship phones currently the s edge i say this to show that i have experience with kindly fires and generally tend to have high standards for my most used devices i know what is a good tablet and what is a so so tablet admittedly my previous fires have been so so but i wanted something inexpensive yet adequate to take places with me instead of my galaxy tab s my hd is the gb option with offers most users will likely be fine with gb and perhaps an added gb or gb sd card however i know how i use my devices so went with the gb option as well as a gb micro sd card in the hours i have had my new fire it has become my device of choice even over my samsung more convenient size i use the large samsung tablet as a computer replacement whereas the new fire replaces my two inch tablets as the go to device before receiving it i wasn t sure about the low resolution x on this tab but honestly it s not a problem sure it s not bright and beautiful like my tab s but its crisp clean and clear the colors are sufficient but not vibrant sadly the comparison photo below is the hd and fire sound is quite good with good volume the speakers are on the left side when portrait on top or bottom in landscape i prefer them on top the sound is good enough that you can enjoy a movie without having to use headphones unless in a noisy environment in which case you would likely want to use headphones anyway read more\",\"kinder fire very hot extremely wonderful tablet it definitely gets the job done adapted very well with everyday usage good speed nice display and one i would definitely recommend to everyone\",\"apr th update good upgrade from last year model beautiful display great device fell short on battery life update on dec please scroll to

ongoing review for this device throughout this next year for comparison sake i will use last year s kindly and ipad mini as they are the closest size to this dx speed this is leaps and bounds faster than last year kindly hd last year kindly struggles to go through any hd video content i put in this year s dx able to play seamlessly all the hd p contents i added it is incredible how much the gh quad processor improved vs last year s model dual gh screen this is the biggest improvement over last year s model the screen is in true hd p x this means any hd content i throw at it will view in its intended resolution the screen is crystal clear much better than ipad mini and the viewing angle is incredible read more\",\"detailed review of the fire hd a great entry level tablet at a great price the fire hd is a great entry level fire tablet that includes a x ppi pixel density display pixel density wise this is the lowest off all the fire tablets but is still decent enough where you re going to get a nice picture on the display it s by no means an ipad killer or galaxy tab killer and you really shouldn t purchase it for that purpose this particular model is really tailored to reading kindly books streaming video browsing the web checking email and so forth bottom line it s a great deal at i m going to compare the features of the hd with the features of the other fire tablets to help you make an informed decision on which model to go with display the display is a x resolution display with a ppi pixel density which is not great but not horrible either it is the lowest pixel density of all the fire tablets with the fire hd coming in at ppi the fire dx coming in at ppi and the fire dx coming in at ppi the human eye really can t distinguish individual pixels beyond a density of about ppi so you re not going to be getting a noticeably pixelated display by any means all in all this is a nice display processor gpu and on board storage the fire hd comes with a respectable gh quad core processor with enough power to run almost all of your content with ease including smooth video playback it comes with a mediocre gb of ram which really is not sufficient in my opinion but it is what it is this is not an ipad or galaxy tab killer by any means but it gives you just enough power to use the essential amazon services you need the hd is substantially less powerful than the snapdragon gh and read more\",\"i have a first generation kindly fire it did every well but was heavy and not as fast as i hoped graphics wise for gaming which is why i upgraded to the dx this new tablet is blisteringly fast and completely fluid with no lag movies books and games are crystal clear and i can now even read pdf s easily which was a core on the old kindly fire the best part is the battery life and light weight i use this kindly all day on one charge i m so happy with it considering the inch also for my wife i can think of no flaws but if a problem comes up with this device i ll update i ve only had it a week\",\"decent inexpensive entry level tablet an amazon com official commented on this review an amazon com official commented on this review what s this the amazon team saysoctober thank you for taking the time to share your feedback we re excited to see your encouraging comments regarding display and sound and appreciate the thoughtful analysis you did of this device compared to the previous generation kindly fire and kindly fire hd as you correctly point out the new kindly fire hd is the successor to last year s entry level kindly fire which

directly from your device we hope you enjoy the new features and services thanks the kindly team\",\"i like many things about the fire i like but the thing i purely hate is the problem with watching flash videos had i known about silk not supporting or the other way around i would have bought the google tablet and will next time i will min\",\"this tablet is amazing first let me say that this is my first fire tablet i ve previously had either ipad s or android tablets i was skeptical at first because i ve generally only liked ipad s but i decided to give it a try and i m glad i did i paid full price for this product and am not being compensated in any manner to post this review let s just jump right to the pro s and con s shall were s fastamazing screen resolutiongreat soundresponsivealexa is kind of awesomebattery life omg i ve charged it once so far i ve watched youtube videos on it streamed a movie and a few tv shows and i use it for facebook and i m not even half way down on the battery after days wow the os the operating system is simple responsive and beautifully done everything is easy to find and it s really easy to navigate con s only one con charge port the charge port is sticky and doesn t seem as high quality overall this is a fantastic tablet and worth so much more than the price i love it\",\"this review is from a normal working non it type of dude who likes to read books surf the web etc etc etc so this will review will be just like me telling you how i think the dx is over a beer my family has singles hd which my son loves dx mine ipad mini older son ipad normal size for the wife and i have used all of them at one time or another size weight lighter and thinner than the ipad mini perfect size to handle i like the location of the on off button and volume much better than my sons hd i dont like to search for buttons on the side speed its seems really fast book pages are in a blink of an eye the web loaded fast not choppy or drag my wifi is pretty good so it helps i have not tried the g yet so i cant comment on that screen wow its really sharp almost as good as my samsung in lcd yes darling it is that sharp did i mention there is no blue or purple gold green or rainbow light around the border if there is it is so light i cant notice it i only used it for an hour or so last night so i will update if this changes but for now it looked clean apps hmm i hear a lot of people b thing about google this or google that who cares there is enough content on amazon to keep me happy not that i am a betting man i will bet there is a bunch more in the pipe line i mixed the kindly out with gb so i assume i will have enough room for years to come very easy to use turned it on entered my wifi password and bam my account was set up in less than minute shipping it was here in day for how can you beat that amazon eco system good stuff period i have always been a huge fan did i mention there is no blue or purple border light so to sum up my thoughts on my new kindly dx is this outstanding i would recommend buying it over an i pad for price value the i pad mini does not offer a gb model and the gb g mini cost which is bucks more than i paid for my mixed out kindly and the gb g i pad air is yea thats right looks the kindly is a really sharp looking device speed fast fast fast screen wow sound clear rich amazon prime works for me i hate shopping in stores love my books and amazon has it all so your pro saying wow this is a normal dude posting a review that says this thing is pretty much perfect well it does seem this way but yea there is always a but the only thing i see that should be included is a back facing camera not that i am one of those parents you see waving their ipad around at a school play or my kids basketball game but sometimes your year old does something so cute while your reading a book you just want to snap the pic this is so minor that i really dont care but just putting it out there for amazon cough cough did i mention i did not have a blue or purple light around the border thanks for letting me post my cents on this wonderful device merry christmas to all ps what is the best screen covers case to get on a side note i returned the kindly it to small for me and i had to drop it down to a stars for being hung up on by customer service twice and the really bad screen flicker\",\"fire ten ok have had this probably weeks wanted to be fair with my review the battery in my kindly fire dx quit talking to the tablet so had to keep it plugged in to use it tried the fire first and just didn t care for how much smaller the screen was returned the waited a bit and ordered the fire amazon did give me a discount due to my problem with the the fire in my opinion is no comparison to the the apps with the works more like smartphone apps in the first three days it froze up times i wondered if it was doing this because i had too many apps opened once i started closing the apps i wasn t using i haven t had the tablet freeze problem i do like the bigger screen on the and the colors are sharp and the pictures clear i also learned that the was no longer being supported by amazon and that meant no updates so eventually a replacement would have been necessary why amazon stopped the is beyond me but i m doing ok now with the if you get it give it some time\",\"hd fire is great for the price people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no for the low price this tablet really does more than expected the camera isn t great however i always use my phone for a camera so that doesn t effect me here are some of the pros and cons pros low cost yet high tech great screen quality of course there is better out there but it looks great as is smooth and responsive easy access to amazon prime content easy to tirelessly share content to a tv battery life web browser works creations doesn t have some apps android users are used to having camera quality isn t great and no flash less extra features than some higher priced tablets have opted to go with the gb version with no ads the ads aren t a big deal but i figured i would pass on having them on my screen no matter what version you pick they all do the same things the gigs may or may not matter to you and gigs both aren t very large but if you want to predownload some tv shows movies music before a vacation then you may want to look into getting the larger gig if you will always have internet connection then it isn t much a problem since you have unlimited cloud storage and can download to your device or stream at anytime you have internet overall if you want an amazon tablet and you want the best go with the dx series however if you want an amazing tablet but don t want to spend as much then these new hd series are great for me and my uses the hd is the perfect fit i would suggest the over the for most buyers the only things the has over the are a larger screen and dual speakers sure the dual speakers is kind of nice but the screen is actually lower quality than the read more\",\"ips screen makes all the difference in the world still no google app compatibility much improved screen it turns out that the fire version released two years ago didn t have an ips screen now it does technically both the old one and this new one are just ppi pixels per inch but this one seems much cruiser than the first generation er my eyes don t lie ips makes the screen a lot cruiser there s also a stunning improvement in color quality with the new screen now it holds its own with the color gamut original ipad mini before it wasn t anywhere near mind you it s not current apple screen quality or current high end samsung screen quality but what is it s only and it s good enough heck at its more than good enough it s great it blows away just about any entry level consumer laptop screen that s for sure i pulled out my first gen fire the one this replaces and placed it side by side with this new one the colors including a horrific green tint on white backgrounds on the old one weren t video worthy ok for casual videos on facebook and youtube maybe but not good enough for netflixing and amazon prime this new one though it s movie worthy especially with headphones ok only with headphones i d prefer p over the fire s p p is better than p dvd s but not ask good as even entry level p ndtv quality but overall even at p it s eminently watchable by the way for me streaming video content on amazon prime instant video has been noticeably sharper than streaming youtube i think amazon prime adapts to p max for this tablet while youtube is is probably delivering only p remember youtube s defaults are p p p and up read more\",\"hd fire is great for the price of people

turns years old this year and we thought that tablet would be a nice birthday gift for her her younger sister has fire so it was logical for us to buy fire for her as she s older we bought this tablet for her more with an educational purpose than to watch cartoons my husband is a software engineer and he really wants our daughter to learn how to code there are so many different apps for that we have already tested it today when the tablet arrived but haven t shown it to our daughter yet there are three different colors and we chose the blue one as it s her favorite color it s very bright the case looks like removable foam shell very sturdy and easy to grab it s actually a very nice decision of adding yellow color because when brother and sister share one device it s better to go neutral there is a possibility to expand storage up to gb but i think gb on board will be more than enough for my daughter big outputs make it easier to access to the volume and power buttons as well as the charging port and headphones jack the display is ok for the price when i watched pepper pig images looked sharp and colors were vibrant even at extreme angles the sound is much better here than in fire kids edition and that s due to dual stereo speakers i don t know how easy and intuitive the interface will be for our daughter but for us it was great nothing odd or unnecessary my favorite option is parent control i can password protect purchases including in app purchases wi fi access and more read more\",\"freetime makes me angry so so angry as the kids edition is nothing more than a basic kindly fire with some extras this review is primarily concerned with the worth of extras bundled with the kids edition primarily the year of included freetime as for the guts of the tablet itself it s fine not great but certainly fine it s not the fastest tablet it isn t the most feature rich tablet it doesn t have the shares display but it s only so it deserves to be graded on a curve for a tablet it s great now grab a coffee get comfortable because i have some thoughts on amazon s freetime service for kids parents price plus the year of freetime were the selling points for me the case and added warranty were nice bonuses the problem is freetime though fantastic in theory isn t even half baked it s a lump of dough left on the counter to rise and then whoever was supposed to put it in the oven got distracted and forgot about it it s getting mold and it smells kind of funny freetime great in theory terrible in practice normally when you buy a new tablet it might have a little bloatware pre installed but you generally don t start with the offerings of the entire app store on your homescreen you find and add the apps you want the way you install remove apps in freetime is sort of backwards it s subtraction every single title is served up on the home screen and in the apps books videos screens these aren t technically pre installed but to a young kid looking at a sea of icons it looks like he has all of these wonderful titles at his disposal well he does but only sort of he clicks elm s face and the wheel starts spinning over the icon while it downloads read

hope this review with my experience helps users decide if this is the right device for them this will be an ongoing review for this device throughout this year for comparison sake i will use last year s kindly fire hd and also the fire dx as benchmarksspeed the same chipset is used on the kindly fire dx as it is in the kindly fire as i mentioned in the review this is leaps and bounds faster than

buy this tablet the resolution is just as good on the as the dx starts up faster that the dx it s a nice size not a solid square like the ipad s i saved myself by buy the refurbished there is nothing wrong with it i highly recommend this kindly over than a high priced ipad\",\"the perfect kids tablet the fire hd kids tablet is essentially an hd with the kids cover freetime and a year warranty lots of improvements over the previous kids edition tablet such as dual band wifi higher quality p screen dolly stereo speakers double the storage and increased battery life the kids cover allows your little one to get a good grip on it and also provides exceptional protection from drops the ips screen has excellent viewing angles vibrant colors and offers plenty of brightness indoors however once you move outside the screen will wash out if you re in the sun the dual speakers give you true stereo sound and offer plenty of volume it s a shame that the cameras don t offer higher resolution but none the less the rear cam does take a decent picture even if your hands aren t that steady should you fill up the internal storage you can add up to a gb micro card freetime has a wealth of content and it includes a kid safe web browser that will only load sites that are whitelisted by you or amazon if you don t want your child using the browser then it can be turned off you can also restrict access to certain categories set time limits and view what your children are watching and reading with the parent dashboard after the first year there is a nominal fee to continue using the service tips you can view amazon videos offline when not connected to wifi switch to your adult profile and download the video s now go into settings profiles and family library select your child profile add content videos and select your videos you can sideload google play and gain access to even more apps such as youtube kids you can set freetime to only allow entertainment content after daily educational goals have been met\",\"after considering the price to purchase of them and checking out the apps my husband and i were pretty sure we would purchase i purchased of these kindly kids edition tablets for my toddler ages years old and non kids edition one for our older child for easter i was quite nervous that they d break or the cases wouldn t be durable or that they wouldn t be able to use the apps they d been using on my samsung tab s after considering the price to purchase of them and checking out the apps my husband and i were pretty sure we would purchase them then i came across the warranty year worry free guarantee are you kidding me i knew there had to be a catch i couldn t find one and at that point we were convinced it would be a good investment i ordered at the time pink and blue were our only color choices so we have pink and blue which has caused a host of issues on the toddler level identifying who s tablet is who s as you can imagine they were easy to set up and create their own profiles and add apps to each of their tables i love the unlimited freetime they ve had their tables for a few months now and can completely work them themselves and download the apps movies books that they want i don t have to do it for them with the exception of my year old of course i was able to link our disney movies anywhere account with our amazon account and now they can access all of our disney digital movies on their tables which was a huge win for us i do wish that amazon could figure out a way for us to be able to link our ultraviolet movies it s a huge summer that amazon doesn t offer any app to make that possible i also love that i can login to my amazon account and send apps movies etc to their tablets as i see fit i can locate and page their tables when they are misplaced and remote lock them if i need to read more\",\"i wanted to like this tablet ended up somewhat disappointed i bought this tablet for its size economical price point and the ability to watch content offline and it offers exactly that but falls short on performance parameters if you re price sensitive and are looking for a value tablet large screen and the ability to watch content offline this is a great device to get however if you already have an earlier kindly like the dx or even an earlier version of the fire i recommend keeping your tablet since this device wouldn t really be a worthwhile upgrade i have been disappointed with several operating shortcomings of the device the constant freezing of the device slow speed to load apps significant tags when switching apps that only become worse as you load more stuff on the tablet erratic wifi connection that drops often and the ensuing trouble to connect back to the same network and the frequent need to reboot the device all factors made this a frustrating device to own the dx is far better in every aspect heck even the original fire runs better than this device the only good things about this device are the screen size and the micro slot so if you re only watching videos on this and would like to have the option of watching content offline when you re traveling this tablet would be just fine otherwise the dx is still a better option or you could get the or fire models those are priced cheaper and work better original review is below for the price point and size alone the fire hd would seem like a good deal for its performance however it falls short of expectations i would probably rate it a overall if it wasn t for the price the rating would have been even lower read more\",\"best value especially with prime but beware mine has dead pixels works with gh astute benchmark despite the dirt cheap price i find it to be great for casual use videos play nice games even play nice text is just not as sexy looking as higher resolution screens watch the video for full demo the short summed up version it s the new budget king in the size it s screen is a little lower in resolution but still pleasant to look at it has enough power for most of the typical tablet tasks and it shares many of the same features as its higher priced brothers such as front and back cameras b g n wifi and good overall battery life minus an hour my favorite size tablet is so if you re looking at the amazon fire lineup i would take this over the for sure and would have a hard time picking the fire at x the price if you re not a prime member it s still a good tablet if you are a prime member it s a great tablet possible quality control issue mine had two dead pixels not very noticeable but still will exchange you can load apps enable unknown sources i loaded astute and panasonic image app both work properly just some background i currently own tablets not including this new one ranging from a book color a samsung tab pro lg g pad x an old acre a and an off brand suffice it to say i know my tablets main cons dead pixels front and rear cameras are low resolution mostly good for video calls only speaker sounds tiny like a small laptop gets recently loud use headphones text not very crisp but still decent to read the rest are overall positives is my favorite tablet size is just a bit too tiny and can be cumbersome uses a slightly slower quad core read more\",\"unreal performance for i couldn t be happier of people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i ll preface this by saying that i own an ipad and was not expecting a tablet to perform at anywhere near that level i have followed the early reviews closely and after seeing enough satisfied customers i figured i d give the kindly fire hd a try i chose the base gb with special offers and my plan was to use it as a secondary e reader and a secondary or even tertiary vehicle for internet access what i ve found is a powerful little tablet so far completely free of the bugs and lang speeds mentioned in the early reviews in fact performance has so exceeded expectations that i consider this perhaps the year s best purchase first off the look is nice it s sleek i ordered the black model and though actually quite a bit heavier than i d imagined it s not heavy enough to be considered a negative the display is fantastic and its quality was the first big surprise the touch screen performs incredibly well and to this point i have experienced immediate response to the point where i have to say touch response so far is indistinguishable from my ipad based on early reviews this was not the case so i have been quite pleasant surprised the fire is very user friendly and easy to input for those who do not feel confident with navigation of a new device there is an immediate onscreen tutorial with an option to skip to guide you i first checked out the e reader function my books loaded immediately and easily from the cloud and i really like the functionality of the reader read more\",\"decent inexpensive entry level tablet people found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes

fire hd fits securely in this attractive case when i purchased my kindly fire hd this was the recommended case at checkout i purchased it thinking that an amazon sourced based should work and fit well i m very happy with my choice of this case both with its style look and function the price is much lower than that of the case in which i keep my kindly paperwhite but is still fairly expensive given the cost of the fire to my match my black kindly fire i chose the charcoal black version which is actually a tweet style look in various shades of gray and black it has the look and feel of fabric versus the plastic covers i have used on my paperwhite the inside is a black microfiber cloth for screen protection it does not have an internal pocket my kindly fire fits securely in the plastic shell and can stand both landscape and portrait with a flip of the case the case has a magnetic cover which keeps it shut or open without the front cover having to be held manually in place whether the case is open or closed the ports for charging the micro port and headphones as well as the control function buttons are exposed when it is closed the cover covers the speakers and the front facing camera lens when the cover is fully open and folded to the back the rear camera lens is covered the front facing lens is fully exposed when the case is open if you wish to use the camera for photos or video while it is in the case you can hold the front cover in your off hand while it is in use as i have a tendency to leave my paperwhite on and run down the battery fairly regularly i appreciate that this cover automatically turns itself off and on when you close or open it\",\"there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn t stand up one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no while this case fits a th gen fire perfectly there is no comfortable way to hold it and it doesn t stand up on it s own for viewing returning to try another style\",\"yes and no i like the case for the primary reason that i bought it to protect my new kindly but as a stand it has its drawbacks i am not comfortable at all with trying to use it in the vertical position and in the horizontal it is stable enough for watching movies or videos but at home i have another stand that i use if i am playing any of my games on the tablet good price and i am pleased with it as protection for my tablet not near as pleased with it as a viable stand\",\"it was recommended on the tablet page i bought this case at the same time i bought a new fire tablet during prime days it was recommended on the tablet page so i thought i was getting the right case well it doesn t fit not by a long shot then i realized the case was for a new fire for like mine but th generation not th since it does not fit i now have to return it and at my expense arg i can t even exchange it for a new one because apparently amazon does not make this case for the th generation fire yet you update one of your products then release it but you don t put out a case for it at the same time with amazon when will you start selling amazon cases for the amazon fire th generation i m not happy with amazon right now and am wondering whether i should keep the tablet if i can t get a case for it that has the vertical stand feature that the amazon case has\",\"this is perfect a lot of people were commenting that the this is perfect a lot of people were commenting that the case falls off and it s not portable that s not the intended use of the case it is strictly for decorative use it look great and comes in several color options would definitely purchase again\",\"good quality case nice case that my daughter needed for her new kindly she earned nice and sturdy its actually better than i thought it would be and serves its purpose\",\"great case one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i am extremely pleased with this case though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the kindly from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the kindly happens to fall on its face this is a great buy and i highly recommend if you want to keep your kindly safe from harm\",\"joshi s screen protectors are so good i choose my devices in part by whether they make them for them i like joshi s anti glare screen protectors so much that the fact that there is one available for the fire phone is part of why i bought a fire phone i ve had these screen protectors on multiple pads and ipod touches over the years and they re the st thing i buy for any device i own particularly those with shiny screens i love that you don t have to worry about if you don t get them on right the first time you can just pull them off and try again i love that when they get dirty you just remove it from the gadget and run it under water to clean it off and then put it back on your device the fire phone does have a smaller been than the pads and ipod touches i ve used with other joshi anti glare protectors but there seems to be just enough that the protector stays on in case you don t understand how joshi s screen protectors work the only sticky part on them is where it covers the been the non screen part of your device i also hate shiny screens and these protectors make devices usable which wouldn t work for me otherwise so glad the anti glare joshi protector is available for the fire phone for some other amazon devices you can only get the regular joshi screen protector i ve used this with the default amazon cases without problem both the leather one and the polyurethane one i just put the screen protector on first and then the case\",\"you need to remove the case to access the sd slot this is a good thing all in all i am impressed with my primary concern is the price when comparing to other solutions nevertheless has received the and installed the product i believe that i meets my specific needs and expectation this case is unlikely to protect my fire hd in a foot drop it does however protect my kindly from spills and low drops what i want and what i have is the ability to without forethought turn off the kindly when the cover is closed to save power moreover whether by design or oversight the fact that the sd card is covered e g you need to remove the case to access the sd slot this is a good thing all in all i am impressed with product s fit e g the camera hole is perfectly aligned the tablet speakers are well positioned for audio and the case folds into both landscape and portrait support positions bottom line i m happy with the purchase and can recommend it to others for consideration\",\"stand wears out quickly one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no this works as a case and matches the color of the kindly nicely the main feature i wanted was the stand however it is only one corner flap as pictured i incorrectly assumed there might be slightly more technology involved there is no stop or anything to keep it from going completely flat backward starting out my kindly would sit at a nice degree or so angle from the table but now my kindly will sit at maybe degrees off the table eventually it will just go flat i ve had it for maybe weeks if the stand feature is important to you get a different case\",\"beautiful and functional originally got the walnut cover with my oasis it s very nice and i would describe it as a sued material for me the walnut cover didn t age well lots of scratching which is necessarily a bad thing but it also seemed to darker a bit which made it a bit dirty the merit cover is also very nice and ages a whole lot better after some months of use it looks as good today as when i first bought it oasis covers in general are very functional the nd battery in the cover is genius since i found i really like reading my oasis without the cover i love the easy on off design of the case\",\"great protection for my device this is my second fire and case i love both even though i have not dropped my device i feel confident with the thick foam surrounding it would survive if i did\",\"good protection fits well the ease stand is a little flimsy and the cobalt purple is really blue but for protection it works well\",\"just bad in this day and age of rectangles with screens being covered in various ways its perplexing that you can mess up something as basic as this it covers the fire fine the fit is sung and snaps into place no problem a hidden magnet auto wakes sleeps the display when you open close it the fabric collects cat hair like a pair of cheap black pants yet worst of all is the fold on the back does an awful job of dropping up fire when you want to use it hands free you can get it to stay but it often slides out or just puts the fire at a slightly weird angle whether it s in portrait or landscape orientation the stand on the back is so work that you re better off just using a jar of peanut butter and a couple pieces of chewing gum to get it to stay in place\",\"an excellent choice for a good looking and durable case to protect amazon s new fire hd tablet over the years i ve tried a variety of cases for the various models of kindly and fire tablet that i ve purchased from amazon while i ve found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive i found myself coming back to amazon s own product when i purchased one of their new fire hd tablets and i m pleased with it this is a very good quality cover it fits well and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation it s made of fabric on the outside with a microfiber inner lining to protect the screen of the tablet when the cover is closed it matches the color of the fire tablet perfectly my only hesitation in purchasing it was the price the case all by itself is nearly half the price of the fire tablet but i suppose that says more about how cheap the tablet is than how expensive the case is kind of still i decided to spend the money for this case the tablet needs the protection and i know from experience that amazon s cases are durable and will last for a long time i ve used my original kindly paperwhite first generation model with the amazon leather case since it was first purchased i ll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet i m very satisfied with it notice how the speakers are visible at the top of the tablet when it is dropped up in landscape mode\",\"great protection and looks great all new amazon fire tablet case th generation release charcoal blackperfect fit i really like the case s simple clean design that lets you sit the tablet vertical and horizontal\",\"it s a nice color it fits the fire very well one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no it s a nice color it fits the fire very well however i can not stand it on it s side unless i reverse the fire and put the right side on the bottom the stand does not work on it s left side the way the diagram shows\",\"this case is very well made and sturdy it perfectly matches the color of the tablet this case is very well made and sturdy it perfectly matches the color of the tablet i can not figure out how to use the back as a stand there is only one way it folds so it should not be that difficult it does not work for me so i have given it a star review\",\"huge design flaw good cover love the standing feature one big flaw it need cut outs for the speakers when shut music still plays when active and cover closed to protect screen but there are no cut outs for the speakers thus destroying the sound this is a huge design flaw for the case\",\"a nice accessory for the fire hd as with other recent fire covers by amazon the cover has a snap in plastic shell that holds the fire securely and will not let it fall out i ve used plastic shells similar to this for years with my singles and kindly fires and none of them has ever slipped out another feature that i look for is auto wake sleep which automatically wakes the tablet when you open the cover and puts it to sleep when the cover is closed it s a very useful feature that helps to extend battery life since you don t have to remember to hit the power switch when you close the cover it s also a huge convenience feature other comments all of the fire s ports and controls are on top of the fire which is open on the case the speakers are covered but when the case is opened they re uncovered note that the cover does block the micro sd card port on the side the microfiber inside of the top cover helps prevent scratches to the display screen the front cover can be folded to act as a viewing stand it s a nice feature especially for watching videos with the cover folded back on itself the rear camera is blocked to use the camera you ll have to keep the cover open but honestly how often are you going to use the fire s rear camera which at mp is pretty lame\",\"flimsy unstable cover don t buy it horrible cover for my new third kindly and it seems to be the only option for the kindly fire cover fits th generation the back side of this cover folds like origami paper it bends too many ways is too lightweight and won t prop up or stay dropped up well you can t stand it up to read on a table with any reliability forget it in a real wind or if it gets bumped amazon should have given us a choice between a sturdy cover with strong sides that don t bend all over and another outer flimsier cover that can be bent as desired like this one maggie\",\"great case for a great tablet this is a great case it allows access to all ports and camera while not taking from the protection of the tablet itself it feels very durable and i think it would protect the fire well against accidental drops bumps and scratches as a blind individual touch is very important to me this product feels well made it feels expensive and i m certain looks the same the standing feature is great it stands well for movie viewing or apps that do better in landscape this is a great accessory for the new fire i m sure there will be other companies making cases for it but this is how the folks at amazon envisioned their device and it is amazing don t be fooled in to buying a cheaper product amazon devices do best with amazon accessories\",\"good looking and works well good looking and works well if you re having trouble standing it up vertically or horizontally check out amazon s video link below my only slight quibble is that i find the fire slippery it s fallen out of my hand and i was hoping this case might have more of a grip material\",\"fun durable only a few minor issues i purchased the kindly fire hd after returning a novo idea pad i have also had experience with pads having said that the kindly fire hd is an exceptional value for the money the screen is fantastic glare is kept to a minimum colors a bright and vibrant text is clear and easily read movies look phenomenal in hd also the sound quality and volume is bar none for a device this size the touch screen is responsive and shortcuts like tapping double tapping and pinch zoom work great the size weight and thickness are great for portability it is easily slipped into the interior pocket of a jacket and takes up little room in a backpack the weight and size makes it easy to hold with just one hand and the rubberized back panel is great for grip the amazon store provides an almost unlimited supply of books movies tv shows music magazines and newspapers that is only improved with a subscription to amazon prime now for the negatives the power button and volume rocker are tough to find as they are flush with device and provide little tactile feedback when looking for them i solved this problem by putting a thin strip of colored tape on the side of the device that has these buttons the amazon app store is very limited when compared to the full android app store hopefully the app library will only grow with the device s popularity apps from the full android store can be side loaded in a few easy steps but please be aware that not all apps will work with the kindly lastly the carousel home screen is about as useful as a spoon is for cutting steak say you are finished reading a magazine and want to switch to another app when you go back to the home screen the magazine you just read and are done with is the first thing you see read more\",\"a nice case that works well to protect your tablet this is a good case that provides adequate protection for your new inch kindly fire inside it features a plastic frame that you snap your kindly into the frame solidly holds your kindly into place and also covers the corners of the tablet and protects it during drops the case weighs in at ounces the exterior of the case is a fiber cover that looks stylish it is available in canary yellow charcoal black cobalt blue marine blue and punch red the one in my video is marine blue the top cover has magnets in it that hold the cover closed and also tightly attach it to the back surface of the case when the cover is fully opened the cover also has magnets in it that turn off the tablet when you close the cover and turn it on when you open the cover i like that feature as it helps to conserve battery power the inside surface of the cover is a micro fiber material and that protects your tablet screen from scratches when the cover is closed i like that the micro sd card slot is covered when the tablet is installed in the case that helps to protect the sd card from being lost or quickly stolen a large memory size sd card can cost to almost and the added security is helpful the tablets speakers are uncovered when the tablet is opened and when it is properly stood up in the landscape mode so you can watch a video i show this in my product video all of the top controls and ports are available while the tablet is in the case that includes the volume controls the headphones jack the microphone the power charging port and the power on off button the cover flap can be partially folded to allow you to stand the tablet into the portrait mode or in the landscape mode for reading browsing the internet or watching movies read more\",\"price one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no the case does what it is supposed to do i think because i bought the tablet amazon should have reduced the price of case too price but i wanted a perfectly fitted case and not something that would or would not be compatible\",\"a great choice for a good looking and durable case to protect the new fire tablet over the years i ve tried a variety of cases for the various models of kindly and fire tablet that i ve purchased from amazon while i ve found a few third party covers that have been durable and attractive i found myself coming back to amazon s own product when i purchased one of their new fire tablets and i m pleased with it this is a very good quality cover it fits well and it provides support to the tablet both in landscape and portrait orientation it s

decided to spend the money for this case the tablet needs the protection and i know from experience that amazon s cases are durable and will last for a long time i ve used my original kindly paperwhite first generation model with case since it was first purchased i ll post some photos of the cover to show how it is packaged and how it looks on the tablet i m very satisfied with it\",\"i like my amazon fire tablet case love the color of the cas and seems to protect well loving this case\",\"does the job but too expensive very protective case but highly over priced piece of molded foam\",\"not crazy about this th as a kindly case this works but it s got a few too many negatives to the good it s nice and thick meaning it gives good protection and your kindly snaps into it rather than just sitting in it like my dx s magnetic case meaning your kindly won t fall out if you tip it too far however i hate the flap this has for dropping it up maybe i was spoiled by my last kindly s case but i had one of the magnetic origami ones and the case folded into a very solid support that would hold the kindly up on either of the long sides this one s flap isn t magnetic and it s just one diagonal fold which makes gives far less support the thing tips over or collapses more than i d like it to and if i want to read in landscape orientation i e the long sides go left to right rather than up and down the top and bottom aren t interchangeable that wouldn t normally be a problem but there s a camera on the back of the kindly and the case has a hole for it the problem is there s only one hole which means there s a right way and a wrong way to put the kindly into it like i said none of this would normally be a problem except i sometimes use it while it s charging and my outlet is on the left side of the bed naturally the stand puts the usb thing on the right side of the kindly assuming i don t want to cover the camera i can either prop it up while i read or let it charge while i read but not both i ll probably order a longer usb cable but the one the kindly comes with is too short to wrap around to the other side i wish they d punched two holes in the back and given us options for which direction the kindly fits it s got a canvass sort of fabric covering rather than a hard plastic one like my last case read more\",\"great cover this is a great cover it turns the device on and off by opening and closing and works as a great stand with it either vertical or horizontal it also adds very little to the size or weight of the tablet i absolutely recommend it\",\"nice and sturdy case this case is great it s inexpensive slim and very sturdy i have another kindly fire that s a little bigger so the case is somewhat heavy and bulky in comparison this case is very lightweight yet still protective\",\"great buy great case fits kindly fire perfect\",\"doesn t hold up to description price too high for what it is the case is cute and a nice color fabric is nice seems it will hold up problem is it doesn t stand up as described mine doesn t stand up at all priced is too high for what it is in my opinion i wouldn t buy this case again\",\"huge step down from the older version still not really in love with the new kindly itself on the fence about returning it but this case is just horror it says it stands it doesn t it just collapses no matter position it s in it s flimsy and scratch and does just about nothing complete waste of money\",\"this case is overall quite nice but has started to peel apart on the this case is overall quite nice but has started to peel apart on the edges a little i will try to update this review later on after i see how it holds up the tablet automatically locks and wakes the screen when closing and opening the case which i think is the most appealing part about this case\",\"very complimentary to the new fire hd this is an improvement over the origami case we purchased for my husband s old fire he liked the case but the way it would collapse into several sections when trying to close was frustrating for me this one has only sections so the folding issue is very minimal and it stands up well in both landscape and portrait as long as the tablet is in the correct orientation just give the tablet a if you can t get it to stand i don t usually like blue but the marine blue of this cover and the tablet is gorgeous and they match perfectly there is a nice texture to it that helps immensely with the grip as well as being very attractive the outputs are precise and allow for charging without removing the cover i often have difficulty with close fitting hard plastic cases but i had no trouble removing this one when i needed to the only downside is that it does pick up a bit of lint at times overall a very nice classic case\",\"the case itself is amazing it looks good one person found this helpful was this review helpful to you yes no i own the merit cover since it came with my kindly oasis after paying near for device and original cover i was hoping replacements would eventually come out so when they did i saw the price tag and immediately became saddened this was probably already in the works but it was an idea i submitted to amazon when i made my original purchase the price is simply outrageous the case itself is amazing it looks good smells good and feels good but i can t afford this\",\"only one i have found to work on the fire phone finally a protector that works on the fire phone it is as advertised probably the easiest one i have put on i have put screen protectors on several phones and tablets no bubbles but the best part is that this one actually works on the fire phone this is the third screen protector i have tried the first one was glaze temper glass this is when i found out about the issue with the sensors on the phone you can not cover them if you want the phone to work properly per monday the second one was mr shield for the fire phone although the illustration showed cut outs for of the sensors what was shipped had no cut outs for the sensors the joshi has cut outs for the sensors though it is a little price it was well worth the money monday was very helpful in finally getting me to this protector\",\"secondly it is really soft actually thus it will be scratched easily by anything near your cellphone such as keys or this one really does not have bubble problems yes because the screen part is actually thinner than side part thus it is actually floating above the screen while it cause a problem that the touch screen is not as sensitive than in the previous time secondly it is really soft actually thus it will be scratched easily by anything near your cellphone such as keys or coins i would like to say that design is okay but it is not satisfactory as a screen protector\",\"great great for kids makes it easy for them to hold the fire and great protection for when it drops nothing protecting the screen though but so far that hasn t been an issue\",\"great case i am extremely pleased with this case though lightweight it is well constructed and crafted in a way so that it protects the kindly from bumps and bruises and it also will protect the screen if the kindly happens to fall on its face this is a great buy and i highly recommend if you want to keep your kindly safe from harm\",\"don t waste your money on this this is a horrible an overpriced case i ve had this case for less than two weeks and it s already coming apart the little rubber stitching around the case is falling off\",\"i liked the case but unfortunately i purchased the wrong one i liked the case but unfortunately i purchased the wrong one for my kindly my fault amazon as usual there was no problem getting a refund\",\"save your money i typically don t post reviews however don t waste your money on this case i got it on friday and started using it that evening its now thursday and the case is feeling at the edges the fabric around the camera hole has started bubbling and the felt on the inside edge is wearing off i have not had any issues with it standing on its own like other people have mentioned i am giving this a two star mainly because it is still functional i am tempted to send it back but i like the functionality of this case\",\"screen protector it was easy to put on and line up had a hair in it and had to take it of and re clean no problem getting it off and back on again it did not loose sickness no bubbles is correct i don t think it helps with the glare the screen does look a little fuller but i still have problems seeing it in daylight i think it is one of the better screen protectors out there\",\"cover material is very disappointing i have purchased several amazon fire cases in the past and have been delighted in the streamlined design and the vinyl covering very easy to keep clean this new design for the fire hd is fabric how long do you imagine a yellow fabric cover is going to stay clean i can not see any easy way to clean it like i do with the vinyl covers i bought one for myself as well as my mother i will keep them but i sure hope they don t turn around and produce vinyl

pretty similar in sound to the earpods but i would definitely give these a step up from the apple headphones hands down one thing i did love about the earpods was that i could still hear everything around me while i had both headphones in these are the same way some may not like it but i think it s perfect for use around the house at work or even for working out i like for the fact i can still hear things going around me if the ambient noise is too loud just turn up the volume i do want to say that so far they seem to have good lows and mid it s pretty crisp in sound the bass isn t too bad either it s not like a skullcandy set of headphones but the bass is there honestly better than i would have expected for these headphones looks i love the black look angle free cord is very nice to

as far as people saying they don t compare to apple s buds well i don t know maybe they have some crazy exclusive version of apple s buds that are amazing but compared to the regular earpods i think amazon s headphones actually sound a bit better they provide a nice full sound and represent highs lows and mid equally well mainly listening to metal fit and feel some people have complained about
